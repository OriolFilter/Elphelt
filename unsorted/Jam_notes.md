after 2D/f.S jam IADs
after 2D/f.S/5H/2H/6H jam special cancels
5K is +2
Chicken block if jam carded overhead
IB 2D and mash 4F or jump out if you can manage to find where jam uses her 2D
Splitkick > Delay > Ryujin YRC is a reset. You can hit jam out of it. Splitkick > No delay Ryujin is a frametrap, you will take some damage.
Splitkick is -15 on block
2D/f.S>earliest Splitkick is a 2F gap frametrap
6H>earliest Splitkick is a gapless "don't fucking stand or jump" option
2D/f.S> Puffball is 12f gap
6H > Puffball is 7f gap
Puffball is +1 unless very close jam tends to use a 6f option after puffball
2nd puffball is +3 (It is possible to backdash it on reaction, it has 1f active)
Super puffball is +3 unless IB'd. Ib it for free meter and stop mashing throw on wakeup, it's throw invul and used to bait wakeup throw.
Badly spaced j2k (that is a j.2k that hits too high/deep) can be thrown ON HIT as a punish, though sometimes jam can RPS with DP since DP is throw invul
MAX Ryujin is a loaded gun. Please be careful when she has this.
Backdash tends to be good against Jam midscreen and even in the corner if you have a good backdash
