### My thoughts on johnny roundstart coin options

i still will hear some people saying that nah it's fair because "elphelt can go under coin and get a fullscreen carry + oki"
which ofc
if it happens
it's  badonkas nice
but basically she has to press a button that gets beaten by half of johnny kit, meanwhile coin will recover before coin hits, he can still press 6SH and OS throw/c.S, which if lands scores a CH
otherwise gets a throw, which is the best scenario
5H / 6H means death, he still can roundstart 2S and 2D
it does beat late coin, f.S, 6P and coin coin i guess 🤷‍♂️
MF  K too (the mid one)
like there are ways to beat coin
you can even punish it
but you risk yourself that if he does something that it's not coin you are dead 

to beat coin you can

some chars ye
not all of them
def not baiken
roundstart runup press 5P right when coin is in your head so you cross the coin and dont get hit by it, but not late enough that johnny can block so you get 5P f.S 5Hx4 or 5H Bridal (the second is better)
otherwise you can also 662D roundstart, not short enough that 2D whiffs johnny's feet, not late enough that it does whiffs because retracts his feet back shortly after
if 2D hits you can : pull berry, pull shotgun, bridal
if you bridal and you are not close enough you gotta manually delay bridal to avoid being hit by coin, since elphelt animation gets to stand up and coin will be located at the back of her head, hitting you out of bridal
all of this options get beaten by johnny pressing a button
she still can do 662S > 236K, which beats roundstart 6P and "coin i guess"
(you roll to avoid the coin)
but since there is no CH i guess it's better to pull sg
you can also 662S> another manual delay of 5H, cause same as before, coin at ur head hitbox
it does beat coin and 6P, i guess it's far better than the previous one

but since no CH, gl confirming that > for fuck sake don't whiff 5H, johnny will press 2H
in resume
vs johnny
i block roundstart
i should* block roundstart
okay
if you delay 1-2 frames bridal and johnny is frameperfect when doing coin roundstart
you can hit johnny out of it
otherwise trades, which again no bueno, actually muy malo
delay it too much? johnny blocks it, which i think means another existencial crisis on why did you press something instead of blocking




662S seems to beat:

Coin (non CH, confirm into Bridal or )


2S trades with some buttons, and still allows you to block coin on whiff



## Jo Roundstart tests








## Stupid combo dropping

----

### 1

first SG.S pull ASAP, delay [SG.H] so pot gets a lower height.

3 [SG.H]

SG.S > delay toss, so it tosses a bit (not a couple frames) before the berry explodes, this gives us time to charge shotgun (gotta try tossing asap and playing with delay SG.S)

we can use the hitstun from the explosion to lower potemkins height, then proceed with SG.S > pull asap, then delay [SG.H] to lower potemkin even more

> Question 1: How to get closer to pot so SG.H wallsplats?

Microwalk after lowtoss (part 2 ending, not part 3)/before first SG.S?    <--- this might be the right answer

After the first SG.H, a 1 frame microwalk before shooting the second shotgun seems to put you in wallsplat range.

> Question 2: How to increase combo length (since we pull berry) to reduce the timer between f.S/5H and berry explosion

Microwalk after lowtoss (part 2 ending, not part 3)/before first SG.S?  ( This only forces us to delay the reload, which might be better than manually wait to delay the shot?)

If we use SG.S > Pull, we can delay SG.H  

Delay f.S by 2/3 manual frames

Delay 5H by ??? frames (need to check)

f.S 2S 5H toss?

> Question 3: Can we do 1 SG.H too high so we won't get pushback?  Answer is yes, still need to try






last [SG.H]   = 43 frames of hitstun (techs at the 43th)


SG.H recovery = 29   =  14 frames available

6H = 15 frames -> NO, 1 frame, probably my maths are wrong, still gotta try

toss = 10 frames

5H = 11 frames (>2toss pushback???)








If berry hits right about to explode (4-5 frames before), opponent barely (or just doesn't) gains height (from being hit by the berry)
