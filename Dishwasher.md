### My thoughts on johnny roundstart coin options

i still will hear some people saying that nah it's fair because "elphelt can go under coin and get a fullscreen carry + oki"
which ofc
if it happens
it's  badonkas nice
but basically she has to press a button that gets beaten by half of johnny kit, meanwhile coin will recover before coin hits, he can still press 6SH and OS throw/c.S, which if lands scores a CH
otherwise gets a throw, which is the best scenario
5H / 6H means death, he still can roundstart 2S and 2D
it does beat late coin, f.S, 6P and coin coin i guess 🤷‍♂️
MF  K too (the mid one)
like there are ways to beat coin
you can even punish it
but you risk yourself that if he does something that it's not coin you are dead 

to beat coin you can

some chars ye
not all of them
def not baiken
roundstart runup press 5P right when coin is in your head so you cross the coin and dont get hit by it, but not late enough that johnny can block so you get 5P f.S 5Hx4 or 5H Bridal (the second is better)
otherwise you can also 662D roundstart, not short enough that 2D whiffs johnny's feet, not late enough that it does whiffs because retracts his feet back shortly after
if 2D hits you can : pull berry, pull shotgun, bridal
if you bridal and you are not close enough you gotta manually delay bridal to avoid being hit by coin, since elphelt animation gets to stand up and coin will be located at the back of her head, hitting you out of bridal
all of this options get beaten by johnny pressing a button
she still can do 662S > 236K, which beats roundstart 6P and "coin i guess"
(you roll to avoid the coin)
but since there is no CH i guess it's better to pull sg
you can also 662S> another manual delay of 5H, cause same as before, coin at ur head hitbox
it does beat coin and 6P, i guess it's far better than the previous one

but since no CH, gl confirming that > for fuck sake don't whiff 5H, johnny will press 2H
in resume
vs johnny
i block roundstart
i should* block roundstart
okay
if you delay 1-2 frames bridal and johnny is frameperfect when doing coin roundstart
you can hit johnny out of it
otherwise trades, which again no bueno, actually muy malo
delay it too much? johnny blocks it, which i think means another existencial crisis on why did you press something instead of blocking




662S seems to beat:

Coin (non CH, confirm into Bridal or )


2S trades with some buttons, and still allows you to block coin on whiff
