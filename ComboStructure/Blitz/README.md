# Charged blitz

After charged blitz they end in crouching state, so f.S >2h is valid.

In order to do this, you will need to delay the first hit.

It also means that we will be able to get substantially more screen carry.

Example for reference:

## Corner Steal

If you are cornered, you can do a (tight) 66236K input, to roll over, and charge a shot.

The example shown is a prototype and requires further investigation.

Since it's quite tight, you could replace that with 66236K (aka, cross-up), then do `SG.S > Bridal`, or `runup SG.PPPH`. (you can add some extra SG.P, just make sure of **not pushing the opponent too far** and losing the SG.H knockdown)

I don't think there is much benefit on aiming for this route instead of taking another one with standard screen carry, yet it could be useful if you missed the timing on the tight 66236K version.

## Standard screen carry

This very much revolves arround pulling 


## Corner

You can straight up pull Shotgun and charge it.

it opens for pullberry  runup c.S f.S 2H toss f.S/2d > shotgun stance
then you can go for sg.S > remove shotgun c.S j.kshd
or charge shotgun sg.S > 214K > shot
if you have blitzed roudnstart you should be able to reach the corner/wallsplat them
on the corner you can pull charged shotgun
