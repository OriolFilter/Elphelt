6H (Ender)

6H (Bridal |> Pickup)

### j.KSH |> (2P >) > (c.S) rejump

`j.KSH` can be perform by doing:

- Genoverse > IAD j.KSH
- Genoverse > 66 ~ j.9KSH


#### General Notes

> Notes:\
> 
> Depending on the height/distance whatever every single button from `j.KSH` will require some degree of delay, specially the `j.H`, since we are rising the height of the opponent (without getting that high that we can't combo), in order for us to land in the ground before the opponent and still have time to pickup with 2P or c.S. \
> 
> The damage difference without using `2P` is that low that it's recommended to pickup with `2P > c.S` for more stability/consistency. \
> 
> Against lightweights I believe `sj.IAD j.KSH` to be more consistent than `IAD j.KSH` (generally speaking). \
> 
> Stuff like IADs look cool, but as per the moment I cannot justify them over doing the `Genoverse > 66 ~ j.9KSH` except the extremely specific instance where I did `Genoverse > 66 ~ sj.9SH` and allowed for `j.D |> f.S > 5H > Bridal` \
> 
> Being able to use IAD also depends on the proximity from the opponent, as being too close would result in dropping the combo (not being able to route j.KSH). 

#### On not prorated combos

At very high distances `Genoverse > 66 ~ j.9SH` _can_ route into `j.D |> f.S/5H` Pickup, but no knockdown.

From `Genoverse > 66 ~ sj.IAD 9SH` I was able to get `j.D |> f.S > Bridal`, once. Since it's an IAD, requires some spacing... For reference, I believe it was on Johnny, nevertheless it's a simulation that resembles something that I would call as too much inconsistent, therefore if one is found in such situation, take the j.D knockdown, you can still do the `superjump IAD` stuff, but aiming to get the j.D knockdown, not picking up from that.

#### On prorated combos


> Notes:\
> 
> Both `IAD` (or `sj.IAD`) should be usable in prorated combo routes, as it's less likely that the opponent goes over your character due to combo gravity, nevertheless I also believe that all the instances that the `IAD` routing can be used, one cana also use the `66 j.9`, therefore for consistency/simplifying things ij recommend going for the `66 j.9` routing on all the main scenarios. \





## Routing into [SG.S] > Pull > [SG.H]x3 > 6H/5H > Toss > 6H Bridal

5H Can be used as a replacement of 6H when one is too far from the corner.

The objective is to know how many `[SG.H]` can we do before proceeding with the main route.+

This assumes we are close to the corner

> Notes:\
>
> To reduce opponent height, after pulling berry we can delay using the `SG.H`. \
> 
> Standard ender used is `6H > Pull Berry`

When the wall spacing is a bit sus. After the 6H we can do a small walkforward to gain a little bit more of wall proximity, it can also act as a framekill since we are waiting for the opponent to fall a bit lower, otherwise SG.S goes under. Technically 3 Reps can be done but requires us to be close to the wall since stun scaling goes tied to time in the combo. On the scenarios where we want to do this route we can do 2 `[SG.H]`, on the scenarios where we can do 3 `[SG.H]` we would be using the route without the `SG.S` | https://fireshare.fihome.xyz/w/b61b1e40025236144fdb4ccd3adcbb03 |
