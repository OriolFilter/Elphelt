### j.KSH |> (2P >) > (c.S) rejump

`j.KSH` can be perform by doing:

- Genoverse > IAD j.KSH
- Genoverse > 66 ~ j.9KSH


#### General Notes

> Notes:\
> 
> Depending on the height/distance whatever every single button from `j.KSH` will require some degree of delay, specially the `j.H`, since we are rising the height of the opponent (without getting that high that we can't combo), in order for us to land in the ground before the opponent and still have time to pickup with 2P or c.S. 
> 
> The damage difference without using `2P` is that low that it's recommended to pickup with `2P > c.S` for more stability/consistency. 
> 
> Against lightweights I believe `sj.IAD j.KSH` to be more consistent than `IAD j.KSH` (generally speaking). 
> 
> Stuff like IADs look cool, but as per the moment I cannot justify them over doing the `Genoverse > 66 ~ j.9KSH` except the extremely specific instance where I did `Genoverse > 66 ~ sj.9SH` and allowed for `j.D |> f.S > 5H > Bridal`.
> 
> Being able to use IAD also depends on the proximity from the opponent, as being too close would result in dropping the combo (not being able to route j.KSH). 

#### On not prorated combos

At very high distances `Genoverse > 66 ~ j.9SH` _can_ route into `j.D |> f.S/5H` Pickup, but no knockdown.

From `Genoverse > 66 ~ sj.IAD 9SH` I was able to get `j.D |> f.S > Bridal`, once. Since it's an IAD, requires some spacing... For reference, I believe it was on Johnny, nevertheless it's a simulation that resembles something that I would call as too much inconsistent, therefore if one is found in such situation, take the j.D knockdown, you can still do the `superjump IAD` stuff, but aiming to get the j.D knockdown, not picking up from that.

#### On prorated combos


> Notes:
> 
> Both `IAD` (or `sj.IAD`) should be usable in prorated combo routes, as it's less likely that the opponent goes over your character due to combo gravity, nevertheless I also believe that all the instances that the `IAD` routing can be used, one cana also use the `66 j.9`, therefore for consistency/simplifying things ij recommend going for the `66 j.9` routing on all the main scenarios. 





## Routing into [SG.S] > Pull > [SG.H]x3 > 6H/5H > Toss > 6H

- This assumes we are close to the corner.

- Standard ender used is `6H > Pull Berry`, unless specified the contrary.

- To reduce opponent height, after pulling berry (`SG.S > 236P`) we can delay the next `SG.H`, this is specially relevant against lightweights, where they might be too high to combo normally, or we might have raised them through hits.

- As per the moment combos mainly only been tested on Sol, unless specified the contrary.

- Dash micro optimization (`66 6H/5H > 2Toss`) is very important for consistency. We as well can perform a dash optimization with the ender `6H` (`66 6H`).

[//]: # (- `5H > 2Toss` results in less pushback than `6H > 2Toss`, therefore it's more consistent, the damage variation is slight &#40;10+/-&#41;, most of the situations `6H > 2Toss` will result in slight more damage than with `5H > 2Toss`, but certain specific situations `5H > 2Toss` will result in irrelevant more damage &#40;1-2 extra damage&#41;.)
 
### When to use 6H or 5H before 2Toss?

- `6H` generally speaking deals more damage than `5H`, usually with a damage variation of 10 +/-. On lightweights `5H` can result on a damage increase of 1-3.

- `6H` results in substantially more pushback than `5H`, which results on berry hitting on later frames, this is as well accentuated when the opponent is located at lower heights, as if they were located in a higher position, berry might have time to hit the opponent before they touch the ground. This pushback can be compensated with the micro-dash optimization (`66 6H 2Toss`), yet can still be inconsistent depending on the opponent height/hurtbox.

- `6H` pushes the opponent down, which on situations where the opponent is too close to the ground might make the combo drop, but on situations where the opponent is too high it might be helpful.

- `5H` results in less pushback than `6H` is more consistent, while still allowing for dash micro optimization for extra consistency (`66 5H > 2Toss`).

- With `6H` pushback, on lightweights and Venom due to smaller hurtbox berry can harder to hit, therefore it's recommended to use `5H`.

- When using `6H` on heavyweights, even if their hurtbox is bigger, it can still be hard to hit the berry before they touch the ground, as generally speaking will have a height closer to the ground compared to other wieghtclasses, therefore it's recommended to use `5H` for consistency. 

- Both 5H and 6H allows for dash micro optimization (`66 6H/5H > 2Toss`)

TLDR:

- `5H` is more consistent than `6H`.
- Use `5H` on everyone including Venom, and excluding the rest of midweights.
- Use `6H` on midweights excluding Venom, yet if the situation looks too tight, you can use `5H`.
- Dash optimization is relevant on both normals (`66 6H/5H > 2Toss`).

When the wall spacing is a bit sus. After the 6H we can do a small walkforward to gain a little bit more of wall proximity, it can also act as a framekill since we are waiting for the opponent to fall a bit lower, otherwise SG.S goes under. Technically 3 Reps can be done but requires us to be close to the wall since stun scaling goes tied to time in the combo. On the scenarios where we want to do this route we can do 2 `[SG.H]`, on the scenarios where we can do 3 `[SG.H]` we would be using the route without the `SG.S` | https://youtu.be/e3zmxdHkXaw |

Does 1 point more of damage than the raw `6H > Loop` route, for consistency/standardization/simplification this route can be used as a default, tho it generates a lil' bit more of Burst gauge, meanwhile it's negligible can be taken into account, specially when it only differs by 1 of damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | https://youtu.be/kQcNYmBl2Gs |
