# 2P before c.S

If the opponent is high enough, we cna use `2P > c.S > whatever` instead of `c.S > whatever` in order to bait some bursts.

# 1PPK

If opponent did burst 2PPK after any of the hits, it is burst-safe (as long we keep holding 1).

The timing is kinda tight.

Useful in clutch situations.

# Spaced 2D > Bridal OS

Scenarios likely to occur after 2S, 5K and f.S.

2K is possible vs characters such Kum or situations where the opponent has an extended hurt box, ie Ky recovery after Greed Saver.

# jc j.X Throw OS

Getting used to it is not that hard.

If you can do it occasionally you will throw a burst.

Just good habits idk.
