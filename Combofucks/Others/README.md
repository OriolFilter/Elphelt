# Corner

## 6P

### > Bridal

- It's implied that requires RC for any of the routes.

#### Shotgun

+ Ends in j.H Oki
+ 50% meter

You want to wait for the opponent to be fairly close to the ground.

[On `Heavyweights`, \[SG.H\] auto-times itself, you also don't have much room for 66 so if you are close enough to the corner, I would suggest avoiding that for consistency.](src/Corner/6P/Bridal/Shotgun/Corner_6P_Bridal_Heavyweights.mp4)

[On `Midweights` you need the opponent to be close to the ground, otherwise 2H might wiff](src/Corner/6P/Bridal/Shotgun/Corner_6P_Bridal_Midweights.mp4)

[On `Lightweights` you need the opponent to be close to the ground, otherwise 2H might wiff](src/Corner/6P/Bridal/Shotgun/Corner_6P_Bridal_Lightweights.mp4)

#### 2H > Shotgun

3 Shots + SG.S > berrypull setup 187

4 Shots + SG.S > berrypull setup 194
(ram? with ram 3 most surely)
(harder to do since need to delay uncharged shotgun shots / sg.p to control the height for actual knockdown)

3 Shots + 6H > berrypull setup 187

4 Shots + 6H > berrypull setup 192
(ram? with ram 3 most surely)


#### Berrypull > 2H

Not worth.

Don't do it.

Useless.
