You want to wait for the opponent to be fairly close to the ground.

[On `Heavyweights`, \[SG.H\] auto-times itself, you also don't have much room for 66 so if you are close enough to the corner, I would suggest avoiding that for consistency.](src/Corner/6P/Bridal/Shotgun/Corner_6P_Bridal_Heavyweights.mp4)

[On `Midweights` you need the opponent to be close to the ground, otherwise 2H might wiff](src/Corner/6P/Bridal/Shotgun/Corner_6P_Bridal_Midweights.mp4)

[On `Lightweights` you need the opponent to be close to the ground, otherwise 2H might wiff](src/Corner/6P/Bridal/Shotgun/Corner_6P_Bridal_Lightweights.mp4)
