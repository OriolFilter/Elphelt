Burstsafe SG throw?

## Speednotes

- Stuff like `SG.S > remove shotgun > 2K` seems to be DP safe.

> well, you have a lot of scripts where i just insert DPs, so obviously you should bait those from time to time, don't break your pressure for baits too often, esp since your punish reward is much greater than my. And you have very patient El, your corner pressure is very reserved, you almost always stay at some range and give opponent time to make mistake, which is not bad, but it makes it pretty easy to jump out and imo El is about corner cherry pressure, so you probably should be more active there even if there is a risk to get hit by DP. And i don't remember you doing this infamous El corener pressure with iad-cherry on minimal height where it hits opponent - low (maybe im wrong with sequence but iad pressure is real, i will try to find some examples). Take this with a grain of salt, since i have no idea how El should be played )

TLDR:

- My Shotgun Pressure is meh on the corner, which leads to people jumping out. I don't feel much comfortable going for it on the Ky Mu.

- I have to work on my safejumps, or more like, I have to have atleast 1 safejump on the corner, I never fo them which also simplifies opponent concerns.

- I was being DPd out of **c.S ~ f.S** frame traps by the DP, yet I didn't really start to bait them. I've to be more aware of my pressure in relation of the opponent. As well, I believe that when spaced I should be able to 2D instead of using 2S, and still should be safe/maybe clash their DP.  

Other stuff:

- Check at which effective HP standard 6P berry route kills with 100% meter (no burst or IK duh). Same for 2D routing.

- I'm getting smoked by scum dipper when doing pressure > Berry. Gotta learn to hold them fruits and as well learn at which distance it is safe to throw. As well how to reach such spacing.

- Tech throws. Tech throws. Tech throws. Tech throws. Tech throws.

- Shotgun/Corner pressure in general, but idk.
