## Generic routes

### 6H Counterhit

#### Midscreen

no clue just do some bnb 

#### Corner

[Elphelt_Generic_6H_Counterhit_Corner.mp4](src/Generic_Routes/6H_CH/Elphelt_Generic_6H_Counterhit_Corner.mp4)

#### Corner Slightly Spaced 

[Elphelt_Generic_6H_Counterhit_Corner_Slightly_Spaced.mp4](src/Generic_Routes/6H_CH/Elphelt_Generic_6H_Counterhit_Corner_Slightly_Spaced.mp4)

## Punishes

### 2H

#### w.o Shotgun

##### c.S / f.S

We can use `f.S` as long Slayer 2H was not made at peak range.

If close enough we can start the combo with c.S.

Ibing Slayer's 2H will facilitate the timing of landing f.S.

[Punish_2H.mp4](src/2H/Punish_2H.mp4)

##### Throw

If the opponent is close enough we can throw him into the corner or whenever we want.

[Punish_2H_Throw.mp4](src/2H/Punish_2H_Throw.mp4)


#### w. Shotgun

If the opponent is close enough we can `SG.P > SG.H`.

At all ranges we can `SG.H`.

Ibing Slayer's `2H` will facilitate the timing of landing `SG.P` or `SG.H`.

[Punish_2H_w_Shotgun.mp4](src/2H/Punish_2H_w_Shotgun.mp4)


#### JBH

If the opponent is close enough we can `Judge Better Half`.

[Punish_2H_JBH.mp4](src/2H/Punish_2H_JBH.mp4)

### Mapa

#### P Mappa

Only punishable on Shotgun stance **AND** IB.

On Block is `-1`, on IB `-5`, but .

##### w. Shotgun IB

- While using Shotgun stance__AND__ IBing the attack.

If we have IBd Mappa, we can stuff a `SG.P` **If we are close enough** to hit Slayers arm, then chain into `SG.H`, it's also quite tight.

[Punish_P_Mappa_w_Shotgun_P.mp4](src/Mappa/Punish_P_Mappa_w_Shotgun_P.mp4)

If we are not extremely close or don't want to do a tight `SG.P`, just `SG.H` from midrange to poke them.

[Punish_P_Mappa_w_Shotgun.mp4](src/Mappa/Punish_P_Mappa_w_Shotgun.mp4)

#### K Mappa

##### w.o Shotgun IB

You will need to IB the hit.

> 5P > f.S > 5H > Bridal

Not punisheable at peak range as `5P` won't reach Slayer.

[Punish_K_Mappa.mp4](src/Mappa/Punish_K_Mappa.mp4)

##### w. Shotgun IB

- While using Shotgun stance__AND__ IBing the attack.

If we have IBd Mappa, we can stuff a `SG.P` **If we are close enough** to hit Slayers arm, then chain into `SG.H`.

[Punish_K_Mappa_w_Shotgun_no_P.mp4](src/Mappa/Punish_K_Mappa_w_Shotgun_no_P.mp4)

If we are not close enough or don't want to do a tight `SG.P`, just `SG.H` from midrange to poke them.

[Punish_K_Mappa_w_Shotgun.mp4](src/Mappa/Punish_K_Mappa_w_Shotgun.mp4)
##### IB JBH

Close enough we can fit a `Judge Better Half` or it's burst version, I repeat, **close enough**.

Can't recommend using that.

[Punish_K_Mappa_JBH.mp4](src/Mappa/Punish_K_Mappa_JBH.mp4)

### Pilebunker

#### Midscreen

##### w.o Shotgun

- IBing will facilitate the timing, but it's not required, certainly facilitates everything.
- Dash momentum and being point-blank spacing with slayer is required if `2S` will be used in the combo, as otherwise `2D` will wiff, therefore, if not sure if the conditions are met, just skipp 2S altogether.
- We can also throw for sideswap (or metered throw corner combo)

The base route would be as: 
> 66 > c.S > f.S > (2S >) 2D

After 2D we can Bridal, pulling a berry, throwing `Genoverse`, air-pulling berry, getting into Shotgun stance, etc. 

Still, if we intend to use `Genoverse` or `Roman Cancel` to extend the combos, I suggest to remove the `2S` and for `Genoverse` specifically I would also remove `2D`.

Genoverse:

> 66 > c.S > f.S > Genoverse > Stuff

RC:

> 66 > c.S > f.S > 2D > RC > Stuff
 
non-dash momentum or point blank spacing:

> 66 > c.S > f.S > 2D > ender

###### Bridal

> 66 > c.S > f.S > (2S >) 2D > Bridal 
 
[Punish_Pilebunker.mp4](src/Pilebunker/Punish_Pilebunker.mp4)

###### Berry Pull

We can also replace `Bridal` for `Berry Pull`, this might be preferred to do in the corner.

> 66 > c.S > f.S > (2S >) 2D > Pull Berry

[Punish_Pilebunker_Berry_Pull.mp4](src/Pilebunker/Punish_Pilebunker_Berry_Pull.mp4)

###### Throw RC

After the throw, the combo would be:

> RC > 236K or 236H > charge shotgun > [SG.H]x3 > charge shotgun > SG.S > 236P > [SG.H]x3 > SG.S > berry toss > charge shotgun > [SG.H] > 6H > 236P

[Punish_Pilebunker_Throw_RC.mp4](src/Pilebunker/Punish_Pilebunker_Throw_RC.mp4)

##### w. Shotgun

> SG.S > Bridal

[Punish_Pilebunker_w_Shotgun.mp4](src/Pilebunker/Punish_Pilebunker_w_Shotgun.mp4)

#### w. Shotgun IB Corner

- Very tight.
- Needs to be **VERY** close to the corner.
- Quite meme since it's quite tight and corner proximity is required.

> [SG.H], [Charge Shotgun] > SG.S > Pull Berry > [SG.H]x3 > [Charge Shotgun] > SG.S > High Berry Toss > [SG.H]x3 > 6H  

[Punish_Pilebunker_Corner_w_Shotgun_meme.mp4](src/Pilebunker/Punish_Pilebunker_Corner_w_Shotgun_meme.mp4)

### Crosswise Heel

Depending on the distance on which IBs `Crosswise Heel` it might allow for a better punish. Doesn't make much difference without IBing.

After IBing the second hit of `Crosswise Heel`, before inputting `c.S`, slightly delay the move, otherwise f.S will be triggered.

As well, it's recommended that after IBing the second hit of `Crosswise Heel`, do a microwalk forward to facilitate `c.S` connecting. This slightly improves consistency.

#### Far hit

From a far hit there isn't much to cash in.

Go with some corner carry string and call it a day.

We can still RC to extend the combo, or Genoverse.

> f.S > 5H > Bridal

#### Midscreen

##### Close IB

Generic c.S Antiair Counterhit BnB

> CH c.S ~ 2H > 236P > c.S > j.S > jc > j.K > j.S > j.H ~ j.toss |> 6H > 236H > (walk in >) SG.S > 236H > j.KSHD | j.SPSHD > j.236P   

[Punish_Crosswise_Hell_Midscreen_IB.mp4](src/Crosswise_Heel/Punish_Crosswise_Hell_Midscreen_IB.mp4)

#### Corner

##### Corner Close IB

[Punish_Crosswise_Hell_Close_Corner_IB.mp4](src/Crosswise_Heel/Punish_Crosswise_Hell_Close_Corner_IB.mp4)

##### Corner w. Shotgun Close

More or less a BnB routing.

> CH SG.H > SG.S > Bridal > SG.H > c.S > j.K > j.S > j.H > j.D > j.236P

[Punish_Crosswise_Hell_Corner_w_Shotgun.mp4](src/Crosswise_Heel/Punish_Crosswise_Hell_Corner_w_Shotgun.mp4)

##### Corner w. Shotgun Close Bridal Loops

Same as above, changing the ender to Bridal loops.

> CH SG.H > SG.S > Bridal > SG.H > c.S > 5H > Bridal > (2P >) > c.S > 5H > Bridal > (2P >) > c.S > 5H > Bridal   

[Punish_Crosswise_Hell_Corner_w_Shotgun_Bridal_Loops.mp4](src/Crosswise_Heel/Punish_Crosswise_Hell_Corner_w_Shotgun_Bridal_Loops.mp4)

##### Corner w. Shotgun Close IB

Same route as the [non IB one](#corner-w-shotgun-close), but IBing might facilitate having a better height for 5H knockdown.

> CH SG.H > SG.S > Bridal > SG.H > c.S > j.K > j.S > j.H > j.D |> 5H > 236P

#### Outspaced

Basically the move wiffs because you are too far away, this is your moment to shine

For the midscreen route refer to the [Generic Routes, 6H Counterhit, Midscreen](#midscreen)

## Labbing

### Mappa and Pilebunker

Set the recordings to the following:

- P Mappa
- K Mappa
- Pilebunker

The idea is to practice, not only the combo routes, but the move recognition.

A reminder that [Pilebunker](#pilebunker) doesn't need to be IBd to be punished.
