## Punishes

### Mapa

#### P Mappa

Only punishable on Shotgun stance __AND__ IB.

On Block is `-1`, on IB `-5`, but .

#### w. Shotgun IB

- While using Shotgun stance__AND__ IBing the attack.

If we have IBd Mappa, we can stuff a `SG.P` **If we are close enough** to hit Slayers arm, then chain into `SG.H`, it's also quite tight.

[Punish_P_Mappa_w_Shotgun_P.mp4](src/Mappa/Punish_P_Mappa_w_Shotgun_P.mp4)

If we are not extremely close or don't want to do a tight `SG.P`, just `SG.H` from midrange to poke them.

#### K Mappa

##### w.o Shotgun IB

You will need to IB the hit.

> 5P > f.S > 5H > Bridal

Not punisheable at peak range as `5P` won't reach Slayer.

##### w. Shotgun IB

- While using Shotgun stance__AND__ IBing the attack.

If we have IBd Mappa, we can stuff a `SG.P` **If we are close enough** to hit Slayers arm, then chain into `SG.H`.

[Punish_K_Mappa_w_Shotgun_no_P.mp4](src/Mappa/Punish_K_Mappa_w_Shotgun_no_P.mp4)

If we are not close enough or don't want to do a tight `SG.P`, just `SG.H` from midrange to poke them.

##### IB JBH

Close enough we can fit a `Judge Better Half` or it's burst version, I repeat, **close enough**.

Can't recommend using that.

### Pilebunker

#### Midscreen

##### w.o Shotgun

- IBing will facilitate the timing, but it's not required, certainly facilitates everything.
- Dash momentum and being point blank with slayer is required if `2S` will be used in the combo, as otherwise `2D` will wiff.


The base route would be as: 
> 66 > c.S > f.S > (2S >) 2D

After 2D we can Bridal, pulling a berry, throwing `Genoverse`, air-pulling berry, getting into Shotgun stance, etc. 

Still, if we intend to use `Genoverse` or `Roman Cancel` to extend the combos, I suggest to remove the `2S` and for `Genoverse` specifically I would also remove `2D`.

Genoverse:

> 66 > c.S > f.S > Genoverse > Stuff

RC:

> 66 > c.S > f.S > 2D > RC > Stuff
 


###### Bridal

> 66 > c.S > f.S > (2S >) 2D > Bridal

###### Berry Pull

We can also replace `Bridal` for `Berry Pull`, this might be preferred to do in the corner.

> 66 > c.S > f.S > (2S >) 2D > Pull Berry

[Punish_Pilebunker_Berry_Pull.mp4](src/Pilebunker/Punish_Pilebunker_Berry_Pull.mp4)

##### w. Shotgun

> SG.S > Bridal

[Punish_Pilebunker_w_Shotgun.mp4](src/Pilebunker/Punish_Pilebunker_w_Shotgun.mp4)

#### w. Shotgun IB Corner

- IB is required.
- Very tight.
- Needs to be **VERY** close to the corner.
- Quite meme since it's quite tight and corner is required.
