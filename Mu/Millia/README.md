As much as Millia players would like to complain about `f.S`, the real criminal is Elph `5K`.

Remember to not put yourself in pin range.

According Xyzz, aim where she will be, not where she is! (Truly a mosquito character in disguise)

Preemptive j.D good.

6H covers huge space on the screen, BUT YOU CAN GET HIT OUT OF IT! So don't get pinned through it please!.

After Millia `6H(1)` beware of possible IAD, you can deal with it by running inside.

Usually IAD scams are from `2S` and `6H (1)`, `2H2`, meanwhile `5K` is rare, it's also possible.

Jump cancelable normals: `5K cS 2S 2H and 6H(`)`

## Xyzz notes

5K is low attack level, so frame advantage is pretty damn bad.

2H has virtually no other options, and you see her do 2H > jump all the time in combos, so it's rare she would intentionally go for that.

the others have reasonable alternatives, so they're good points for her to reset with an iad

## EIiitti notes

Personally I have had a lot of success with 2H > delay 2D because most people try to upback to deal with pin/IAD, so if it's a rare option for others, it isn't that rare for me at least

after a pretty decently + jump-in, frame trapping with 2H is pretty good tbh

1-hit hitconfirm with j9KD if you see the opponent get launched

do jc stuff or delay 2D if blocked

or leave on the -2

2H also frame traps after 2P/2K

but the opponent has to be mashing at the speed of a thousand suns to get caught since the gap is like 1-2f

## Iron Savior

The move yet is -13 on block, so, if you block, you get to press buttons back.

### Contest

You mostly want to hit her feet.

#### w Shotgun

Both charged and uncharged shotgun can hit `Iron Savior` at a somewhat hateful distance.

> **Tip:**\
> Uncharged shotgun can be done while crouchingback so if very misstimed you block it.


#### wo Shotgun

5K can win at the right distance, yet is veeery finiky, skill issue.

At a distance Elp can 6H and get a juicy counterhit.

#### Genoverse

It can hit her, just beware of Millier RC since you would have lost 25% meter.

### Punish

Only focused at further range.

Closer range as per the moment "do the needful".

### wo Shotgun

No need to IB (but encouraged), since it is very tight (mash 5H, hard).

> 5H*5

> Disclaimer:\
> `5H > Genoverse` won't hit! (meaning at peak range)



## Forward Roll > H

### Punish

When at a fair distance, you will need to IB it.

> 5H*5
> 5H>Bridal

With 50% meter we unlock substantial damage/carry.

## Oki

God damm I am so bad at meating Millia, wether i get thrown because I get in throw range, or I get hit by 5H or whatever else.

### Alternative off 2D (if close enough/possible)

Elpheltcord link

Basically 2D > j.PS/K > j.D > Pull and AD as fast as possible (this makes the berry be closer/more catches the backdashes better)

Pot equivalent (with j.S only, do 5k delayed S delayed S > etc)
