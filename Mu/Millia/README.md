As much as Millia players would like to complain about `f.S`, the real criminal is Elph `5K`.

Remember to not put yourself in pin range.

After Millia 5H beware of possible IAD, you can deal with it by running inside.

## Iron Savior

The move yet is -13 on block, so, if you block, you get to press buttons back.

> **Tip:**\
> Uncharged shotgun can be done while crouchingback so if very misstimed you block it.




#### wo Shotgun

5K can win at the right distance, yet is veeery finiky, skill issue.

At a distance Elp can 6H and get a juicy counterhit.

### Punish

Only focused at further range.

Closer range as per the moment "do the needful".

### wo Shotgun

No need to IB (but encouraged), since it is very tight (mash 5H, hard).

> 5H*5

> Disclaimer:\
> `5H > Genoverse` won't hit! (meaning at peak range)

When at a fair distance, you will need to IB it.

> 5H*5

With 50% meter we unlock substantial damage/carry.
