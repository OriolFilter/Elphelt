### Berry?

Don't hold berry.

Holding berry equals to death.

### IABD pull toss

Good enough.

Gets berry on the map so that's a +, for better or worse.

You are also giving your map control so beware.

### Berry high throw

When Johnny is going to hit berry with 5P/6P or whatever, you can use 5H to shoot at the berry/Johnny.

Feels fine.

Reminder that Johnny can still press 6K, MF, 2S, 2D, etc.

If close enough, if he used 6H, and you used 5H too early, you can get counterhit, which is *no bueno*.
