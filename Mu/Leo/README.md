btw writing in match is painful and i didn't want to polluate your session, wanted to say throw more fs at round start range or a bit farther, it has way more chance to hit than a 5k which is going to get counter hit
and if you got counter hit yourself it's easy to confirm and got oki with bridal

fair

Kyouse — Today at 12:56
that's leo specific
fs is a nightmare for him kinda
when he does the parry at max range fs doesn't even get into animation
so you can backdash fs leo in stance 
and you'll be fine anyway lol
(well actually he can confirm the reject i believe, but the reward isn't that big)

Thundax — Today at 12:59
yeah, if you press bt.D and the poke that hits you is at far range all you get is the same animation as if when you are blitzed
you can maybe confirm it into bt.S if it's not too far
dont remember for how long you are rejected

Kyouse — Today at 13:00
no not that
well if yo ugot rejected you wasn't close in the first place
i think it's rekka?
i don't know what that special name

Thundax — Today at 13:00
rekka3?
dritt?

Kyouse — Today at 13:00
but sometimes i get hit by that shit when rejected
yeah this

Thundax — Today at 13:01
once oriol masters these tips my barber will be put out of business...

Kyouse — Today at 13:02
i had way more tips coming in my mind while watching tbh
but i don't want to give too much to someone who didn't even ask for my opinion xD 
please don't let me jump — Today at 13:02
i just learned that leo parry is just spamming the D button

Thundax — Today at 13:02
yeah he doesnt hold it
please don't let me jump — Today at 13:02
I thought u where doing actuall work >:(

Thundax — Today at 13:02
of course not
it's leo
please don't let me jump — Today at 13:02
those top tiers

Thundax — Today at 13:03
i play him because Polish people only activate their brains when stealing cars and robbing Carrefour

Kyouse — Today at 13:03
saying that as if our command grab wasn't a single button

Kyouse — Today at 13:07
well the most important, don't take out a grenade in neutral at mid range
either cancel it from a normal, or back iad
taking it out like that against that kind of "going forward is the only direction i know" wharacter is asking to put you at a bad situation
please don't let me jump — Today at 13:08
true

Kyouse — Today at 13:09
don't back dash too much in his pressure, and definitely DON'T BACKDASH when you're at 3/4 of the screen unless it's to avoid his projectile
this advice might sound wierd lol
please don't let me jump — Today at 13:10
its not lmao
i allowing him to walk forward at that point #

Kyouse — Today at 13:10
instead of backdashing at this space, focus yourself if you see it going forward you press fs and see what happen
if you feel late and it was his charge, well you'll have to block, but don't, backdash 
even if he's in stance you might eat his super
please don't let me jump — Today at 13:11
also I think he could do some OS shit for wakeup backdash in the corner

Kyouse — Today at 13:12
yeah prob, usually i rps the backdash a few time
please don't let me jump — Today at 13:12
well heard that somewhere sometime

Kyouse — Today at 13:12
if he's not in stance
but i'm not familiar with OS against leo tbh
wouldn't be surprise if there's a lot but you know, community is what it is on this game, either you are a lab monster, either you know a lab monster, either you gonna get stuck because in the end you won't be able to fight many people lol
also something else
leo has one of the easiest UB setup
you could have done it a few time
it's a shame
oh wait
https://streamable.com/t5igrv

well i failed the yrc but you get it
i don't do it that much often myself, but this should be our bnb now that i think about it lol
against leo atleast, i say it's easy because it wierdly very consistent
that jk can touch leo pretty low

Kyouse — Today at 13:20
once leo is in well you're in deep shit, we are all equal against a 12 positives moves character going in your face, but elphelt has the tools to not let that happen, but you have to commit to not be afraid and take the fs solution instead of the backdash one
the second option will not get you away, it will get you kill a few time actually
really far away 5h can do the wall
closer go for fs, at a whiff distance it can be very strong 
and 5k, i don't recommend it much it doesn't work really well against leo's favorite button
and can't confirm it if too far
that's it for now

## Roundstart quick notes

### Elphelt Buttons notes:

#### Elphelt's f.S

Doesn't punish backdash, but it's still a win since we get free space for our neutral game.

##### Wins

- 6P, only **wins** if Elphelt uses a followup (`f.S > 5H` or `f.S > Bridal`).

- 2K wins but non-counterhit, can't get anything from it.

- Everything except the listed under.

##### Trades

- 5K

##### Loses

- 6P if Elp didn't chain a followup.
- H DP.
- Leo's S DP (trades), yet if Leo got hit standing instead of airborne, Leo scores advantage due the KD. If Elp delays the f.S 4-5 frames, she can get a CH.

#### Elphelt's 2D

Used to cover instances that Elp f.S doesn't win.

##### Relevant Wins

- 5K, meanwhile Elp f.S trades. 
- Allows punishing Leo's 2K unlike with Elp f.S
- Whiffs against Leo's S DP.
- 1/2 Frames delayed 2D whiffs against Leo's H DP, otherwise clashes.

##### Trades

N/A

##### Loses

- f.S (2D loses and get poked, Leo can only follow it up by 214S.)
- 2D (loses to Elp f.S)

##### Irrelevant whiffs/clashes

> Whiff/clashes and doesn't allow for punish or anything relevant.

- 6P (whiffs, loses to Elp f.S)
- 2H (clash, loses to Elp f.S)
- H DP if Elp 2D isn't delayed for 1-2 frames (clash).
- 2S (clash, loses to Elp f.S)
- 2D (whiffs, still can be blocked, loses to Elp f.S)
### Leo's 6P

Something like `f.S > Bridal` or `f.S > 5H` works.

2D whiffs.

### Leo's 6K

Loses to f.S and 2D, didn't bother about anything else.

### Leo's 5K

f.S/2S trades

5H loses.

6H hits too late, doesn't get a CH, cancel into whatever **but not bridal**.

6P hits too late, can be blocked.

2D wins.

delayed 2k wins, aka ~ 2k>f.S>etc
delayed 2d wins, aka ~ 2D > bridal / shotgun / berry

### Leo's f.S

f.S wins.

2D loses and get poked, Leo can only follow it up by 214S.

5P loses.

5H loses.

6H loses.

on IB can do 5H, but if Leo does `f.S > 5H` ur fucked.

6P "hits" as long doesn't go into stance, also hits if Leo does `f.S > 5H`.

### Leo's 2H

6H Clashes, if Leo delays the 2H you get murdered, so discard this option.

2H loses.

f.S wins/gets CH.

2D clashes.

**1 frame delayed Elp f.S murders you.**

**3-4 frame delayed Elp f.S scores a CH.**

### Leo's delayed 2H

Reminder, Elp 6H murders you. Don't.

### Leo's 2K

2D gets a CH, slightly delayed (1/2 frames) 2D also gets a CH, further delay will whiff, still safe tho.

f.S wins, no CH, can't get anything out of it due to distance. I dont like the idea of pulling shotgun against leo in neutral anyway.

### Leo's 2S

2D clashes.

5K clashes.

f.S wins with a CH.
### Leo's 6H

f.S/2S gets CH.

Delayed 2D gets CH.

6H get CH.

6P gets CH.

2H gets CH.

substantially delayed 5K gets CH.

### Leo's 2D

f.S/2S wins.

2K/5K/2P/5P/2D/6H/5H/Bridal loses.

### Leo's S DP

f.S, yet if Leo got hit standing instead of airborne, Leo scores advantage due the KD.

If Elp delays the f.S 4-5 frames, she can win with an airborne CH.

**2D Whiffs.**

2S loses.


6H Trades.

5H/Bridal loses.

Bridal also whiffs (does it even matter??).





### Leo's H DP

2S/f.S/5H/6H/Bridal loses.

2D clashes.

**1/2 frames delayed 2D wiffs.**

### Leo's Erst

Loses to everything except 6H/6P/Bridal?.

### Leo's Zweit

Loses to everything except 6H?/6P/Bridal?


### TK Siegesparade

f.S/5H/6H/6P wins

Other might whiff.

### Backdash

Delayed 5H hits bd.

6H hits bd.

Bridal hits bd.
