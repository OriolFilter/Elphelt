## Note

Leo goes to stance by holding 5H.

While in "stance" **can't block**, but can use parry.


# Normals

## 5H

> Gatlings into 6H and 2D
 
> **Level 4** move and `-3` on block. On **IB**, it's `-7`, therefore our available options are:
> - 5P
> - 2P
> - 5K (longest range button from the listed ones, active at frame `7`, therefore the punish has to be frameperfect)
> - 2K (Has a lil\' shorter range than `5K` yet it's active at frame `5`, allowing more consistency) 
> - c.S (use if close enough)

The punishes are also tied to proximity.

For consistency due to 5K requiring to be frameperfect to gain slightly more range, **I** recommend going through the 2K routing when available.

2K whiffs slightly after the rounds-tart distance, where 5K .

### Routes

#### 5K

##### Round start

- `5K > f.S > 5H > Bridal/5H*4`, damage: 89/80

- `5K > 2S > 5H > Bridal/5H*4`, damage: 87/78

- `5K > f.S > 2S > 5H > 5H*4`, damage: 102

- `5K > 2D`, damage: 43

##### Slightly past round start

- `5K > f.S > 5H > 5H*4`

- `5K > 2S > 5H > Bridal/5H*4`

> The bridal ender route is quite finicky due to range and requires 2S to work, yet, if the spacing is slightly further, bridal will be blocked, therefore for consistency is recommended to be skipped.

##### Peak range

- `5K > f.S > 5H > 5H*4`

Further than this distance, 5K will whiff.
