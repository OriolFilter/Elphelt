Standard 6H CH Kyouse routing won't work.

It can work if you do superjump IAD instead.

On hitbox with Up SOCD cleaning you can do `[Down] > [Right] + [Up] > ]Down[ > ]Down[ + ]Right[ + ]Up[ (aka release everything, go back to 5) > Right`

Use sniper to deal with Venom setting balls, use the CH opportunity to runup -> pressure or pull berry and throw it while cutting distance.

IT works fullscreen:

On sniper CH -> perfect reload -> SG.H -> Pull berry -> runup meaty oki with SG.P.


SG.H can deal with **small** balls, you can do runnup SG.H.

On sniper, mix switching to SG.H to block/shot balls.

And roll to go over balls.


Geno verse also destroy small balls.

## Oki

### Wake-up DA 

If close enough you can challenge DA with jbh.

Standard Dark Angel is throwable (if close enough) and "can be hit":

- If you do **jbh** at the first frame possible after the super flash, you will be able to get the first hit on Venom into the animation.

- If you are off by 1 frame, you will hit Venom with the later frames, still good scenario.

Burst Dark Angel has more invulnerable frames frames, meaning:

- If you do **jbh** at the first frame, **jbh** will completely whiff.

- If you delay **jbh** slightly, it will hit Venom in later frames.

- Throw is not an option.
