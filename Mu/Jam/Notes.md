## 2D

2D is very helpful to keep yourself in a fair distance.

I believe that the right range to be used is at the tip of `Hyappo Shinshou`, where it should clash.

This forces Jam to rely on more aggressive approaches, which is when you can score big rewards. 


Use 2D+footsies to discourage the use of:

- 6P
- 2K
- 2D
- Hochifu (parry)
- Bakushuu (`236S > P`)
- Hamonkyaku (`236S > K`)
- Hyappo Shinshou (`236S > S`) -> Very likely to clash at tip range, beware of danger time and clash cancel. Might be useful to do OS `2D>[1PK]` to avoid clash surprises, which against `Hyappo Shinshou` occur a lot if properly positioned.

### Doubting

- f.S
- 6H
- 5K (if done spaced, since 2D has longer range, I think)
- Senri Shinshou (`236S > H` or `236S > S > H`)


## 2H

I believe that can go under Ryuujin. **All the levels**.

It's a mid, can be parried very easily, therefore play around 2D / shotgun.

It's a lvl3 movie, maybe doing 2H(1) > berry pull can be helpful, as long they respect you, yet you are going to block most likely afterwards due Jam players being on cocaine or her buttons being fast (5P active at frame 3 bruh).

## Shotgun

### SG.S

Sort of antiair, but, I haven't had much luck antiaring Jam with it due `j.H`.

I believe that can go under Ryuujin, yet, no Idea on which levels can or cannot, and most importantly, if you by any chance finish your recovery and invuln frames haven't finished, you are going home with a counterhit in your face.

### SG.H

Shotgun.H can be useful to counterpoke, but it's important to use it as mostly preemptive distanced hitbox screen filler.

Why? Wiffpunishing 2K / 2D / Hamonkyaku.

Also, those motherfuckers will hit you if you use `SG.S`, and why would you approach when you can 

Could be useful as an antiair, but not feeling it as a consistent solution as you can get tricked by many ways:

## f.S

I don't like it.

Feels like can get stuffed by too much shit (specially 2D), which results on you getting counterhit and Jam scoring a fullcombo.

At that point I feel like would be using 2S, especially when 2S has less startup frames (8 vs 9), and is far more (5 vs 6). Still 2S has 2 more frames of recovery.

## 2S

I like it as an occasional anti rushdown, but since moves the hurtbox forward, if you get counterhit (which is not very hard), you will suffer the consequences, especially if it's by 6H or 6P.

# Oki

Wakup Jam Options:

## DP:

### lvl 1

Invuln frames: 1-6F All

Properly spaced 2D hits her out of DP, or whiffs and you punish the DP.

### lvl 2

Invuln frames: 1-13F All

Properly spaced 2D whiffs and you punish the DP.

### lvl 3

Invuln frames: 1-13F All

Properly spaced 2D whiffs and you punish the DP.


# Punishes

## Gekirin (ground)

> She's crouching state while recovering.
 
> Beware that can cancel into the another followups.

lvl 1: -13.

lvl 2: -6, 2k/2P/c.S > stuff.

lvl 3: -1, Burst Judge Better half, I think.

## Ryujin (ground)

I think that you just crouch and wait for the active frames to finish so you don't get in blockstun status, and Jam is not allowed to do any followup, since could crush you.
