## Ky Roundstart tests

> 5SH,5*47, 5P

### Ky 5P

665K


### Ky f.S

- f.S  Trade (2S Better)
- 2S   Trade (CH Stagger, good enough)

- 2D looses


- 6P   "CAN HIT" too finiky to be relevant.

- Backdash 5H Hits (nothing relevant, cant get anything further than pulling berry, not bad)

### Greed Saver

> Ky on crouching state.

- 2S Looses
- f.S Trades
- Looses to 6H
- Backdash > Wait for Ky to be on ground, we can punish/combo with f.S
- Backdash > 6H Results in a CH.
- Seems to lose to 5H. (cant recommend ever pressing this)

#### Non relevant to roundstart.
- Without IB we can use most of the time use `5K > f.S` to combo from medium range. As long 5K it's in range we can use it.
- On IB we can press f.S to combo from (almost) all distances. On IB, as long 2D is in range, we can punish with it (works at distances where f.S can't be used.)
- If it's very close we can just press c.S to punish.

### 2D

(requires to be blocking with 4 instead of 1, otherwise elphelt will extend her hurtbox and block 2D)

- f.S Looses 
- Delayed f.S wins and comboes into 2h since ky is in crouching state.
- 5K wins/counterhits, can't get anything from it further than pulling berry, not bad but i dont like the distance between me and ky.
- Delayed 2D as a whiffpunish
- 2K Trades
- 2S Wins
- Delayed 6H wins.

### Scum Dipper

- 2D Wins -> Leads to bridal
- 5K Wins (delayed 5K can trade or win and get a short combo out of it if close enough to ky. Too delayed and can lose)
- 2K Looses (delayed 2K can trade)
- 2S Looses
- f.S Looses
- If we IB the first hit we can `c.S` before the second hit, allowing us to get a nice CH.
- We can still block the first hit, and IB the second telegraphed hit, then proceed with a punish (we can take advantage of the proximity we are on and do `66 c.S f.S `) OR, we can do a runup backthrow, so Ky gets set to the corner already.    If we proceed with the combo route, we get very close to 25% meter, meanwhile Ky gets around 15%. If we proceed with the throw route both Elp and Ky get to 15ish% of meter. 
- As long you dont get CH by the first hit, you can still IB the second hit and punish KY.
- Backdash loses.
- Neutraljump delay j.H |> c.S > f.S > 5H > Bridal
