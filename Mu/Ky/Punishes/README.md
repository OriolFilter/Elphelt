## Vapor Thrust

DP

### Vapor Thrust S

As per the moment just do air combo and whatever

### Vapor Thrust H

### Stun Dipper

[//]: # (Normal/FD block the first hit.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (IB the second one for better manoeuvre timing.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Depending on distance)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (> f.S > 5H*4)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (> 2S > 5H > Bridal)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (> 5H *4)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (> whatever > Genoverse > whatever)


IBing the second hit is relevant since allows less timing on your end. BUT NOT NECESSARY TO JUST PRESS A BUTTON

We got different options.


### Very close

On IB:

> 66 c.S > f.s (> 2S) > 2D > Bridal

Without IB:

> f.s > 5H > Bridal
 
It is also _possible_ to do `66 f.S > 2S > 2D` without need of IB, but for consistency I can't recommend.

Same for `(66) f.S > 2D`, depending on how close one is, 2D will whiff

#### DP the second hit.

If we are too close, Scum dipper won't be a "true string", therefore we can throw stuff between the first and second hit.

If we are close enough we can super (Judge Better Half/DP), but only if we are close enough for the first and second hit to not be a true string. 

If we have more distance between us and Ky, but we IB the first hit, we might still be able to DP.

For us to be able to use DP, we need to be at "roundstart distance" as per when Ky did press Scum Dipper.

If we are a bit further than that, we will hit with the second hit of the DP, which is not the end of the world ofcourse, but might want to use the meter for something better instead (DEAD ANGLE).

If we are even a bit further, our super will clash. **No bueno!!**

Even further? it will be a true string, so go for the next listed punishes. Reminder that the second hit **IT'S A MID**, therefore you just gotta press the `4` button once to IB.

### Middle ground

f.S 5H Bridal

### Big distance

(but not peak!)

f.S 5H Bridal

5H Genoverse

> 5H > Genoverse > IAD j.KSH > 2P > c.S > j.SPSHD

### Peak Distance.

At the peakest of the peakest distances 5H Genoverse will not reach.

5H Bridal will not reach either.



f.S Will whiff

> 5H RRC IAD j.KSH |> c.S f.S 2D Bridal

If we IB we can do `66 f.S 5H Genoverse` or `66 f.S 5H Bridal` (basically IB > Dash-in)
