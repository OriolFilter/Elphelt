# Reminder on taking breaks/stretch/water

It's very important to take small breaks, **especially if you have been practicing the same stuff over and over**, just getting up from the computer and going to the kitchen to grab a glass of water, some cookies or something else is a big help for your hands!

Watching a YT video or reading some messages also works.

Try to rest the hands for a bit every now and then!
