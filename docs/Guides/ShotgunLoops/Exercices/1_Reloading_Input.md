# Reloading input

> Note:\
> It's very helpful to have the input display and input history enabled while doing the exercises, as well some exercises might depend on it for some steps.\

> To enable input display, once in the training mode, press start to ender the "Paused Menu", enter the submenu "Display Settings", search for the options "Input History" and "Virtual stick" and enable them.\

This is exercise is aimed towards being used to reloading shotgun input/motion. not to the fastest timing.

First I would recommend trying to _do it_ without previous practice.

Exercise steps:
- Get in shotgun stance
- Shoot
- Try to reload

If you are being able to reload consistently, try to keep a rhythm for a while.

If you weren't able to do it at the first try (which is expected!), check the [sub-exercises section](#sub-exercises) for a breakthrough of the whole process. As well, read the [recommendations section](#recommendations).

## Recommendations

Wait for the shotgun to charge before shooting, this might help towards keeping a "rythm", the audio clue from Elphelt charging the shotgun and the firing sound can also help towards finding a rythm.

While doing the reload, watch the virtual stick move from left to right, this might help to being more aware of the inputs performed.

On fail: Check the history, this is to "understand" which input we did, in case we didn't notice something while watching the virtual stick.

## Sub-exercises

I recommend starting slow and paying special attention to the inputs done through the input stick, to ensure we are doing the `4>6H` Input, through the process we can hit corners

If you are having difficulties being used to the input, you can just visualize it through doing the movement input, without pressing any of the attack buttons.

Once you have visualized the movement input, try pressing the `Hardslash` button at the end. Keep special attention to the virtual stick and confirm that you are pressing the `Hardslash` button, at the same time or after than when you are doing the 6 input. In case of doubt, you can also check that through the input history.

Finally, add a `Hardslash` button at the start, so you do `5H > 4 > 6H`.

If we get 2 `5H` shots, we should be doing the input timing good enough to perform reloads.

Once you reached this step, try again the main exercise, and don't hesitate to go back to this sub-exercises if you still have difficulties.
