# Charged shotgun timing

It's very recommended first being a bit consistent on the reloading of shotgun before moving to this step, as it can make the experience very frustrating.

As well, I believe that getting used to reloading will ease some of the exercises mentioned.

## Exercise 1, sound

The first exercise we don't aim to do nothing further than focusing in the sound Elphelt does when she reloads the shotgun.

> Note:\
> On this exercise, the **AUDIO** cue will be much more helpful than the visual cue, because of that, I encourage to **disable the background music**.\
> \
> The visual cue will be helpful in future steps (specifically on the microwalking section), but I believe that on this one it can create bad habits.

The steps on this exercise will be:

- Pull shotgun
- Wait for Elphelt to charge shotgun and wait a bit longer.
- After waiting for a while, shoot, reload and wait for Elphelt to charge her shotgun.
- Before shooting again, take breath and imagine Elphelt charging the shotgun, specially imagining the "charged sound" she does once it's loaded.
- Once you have done that, shoot, reload and wait again.
- Keep repeating the imaginary process before each shoot, it's very important to be confident before you shoot, if you need more time to "feel it", take it, there is no hurry.

> Note:\
> This doesn't apply to the first one since it's timing can feel a bit different when pulling shotgun than when reloading.

The main goal of this exercise is to be used to the timing between the reload until Elphelt charges the shotgun, so we can have an imaginary rhythm, focusing in the audio cue.

It's okay to mess the reload since it's not the main focus, yet if it's happening very often that it's making you loose focus on this exercise, go back to the [reloading input section](./../Exercices/1_Reloading_Input.md).

As well, if you find yourself doing a movement input before pressing the H, because you are anticipating the reload, try to slow down the inputs, since again there is no hurry, yet if you find yourself having issues with that, go back to the [reloading input section](./../Exercices/1_Reloading_Input.md).

[//]: # (#### Exercise 1.5, sound, a bit faster)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (It's the exact same exercise as before, just trying to leave a little less time than )


## Exercise 2, progressive speed up

Using as a base the previous exercise, the idea is to progressively "speed up" (aka, wait past charge for less time) whenever you feel confident/comfortable at your current speed.

If you shoot an uncharged shot, you have to "reset" and go back to a slow(er) timing.

[//]: # (???)
[//]: # (I find it helpful not being very focused on the progression/timing you left waiting, but paying more attention on the "idea of the exercise")

Once you are more or less aware of the charge timing, try to slowly go reducing the extra waited time after charging the shotgun.

Eventually you will reach close to the edge of the timing, where you should try to slowly push it a _bit further_ until you make a mistake and shoot an uncharged shot.

On this exercise, **the main goal is to make mistakes** to develop a timing, therefore one shouldn't be afraid of shooting too early, nor ashamed of having shot too early, as **making mistakes is part of the exercise**.
