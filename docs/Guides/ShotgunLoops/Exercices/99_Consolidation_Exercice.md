# Consolidation exercise

As a consolidation of the previous exercises, I suggest practicing the next combo as it makes you exercise the following points:

- Charge shotgun.
- Reloading shotgun.

Combo example:

The routing is:

> SG.D > Pull Berry > SG.S > [Charged SG.H]x2 > SG.S > 2Toss > SG.S > Bridal > [Charged SG.H]x6

> Note:\
> The last charged shotgun can be a bit complicated, if you miss it, don't get discouraged and keep practicing!!
>
> The combo is not intended to be "optimal" nor anything like that, but it focuses in
