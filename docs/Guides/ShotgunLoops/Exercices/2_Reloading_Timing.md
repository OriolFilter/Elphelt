# Reloading timing

On this part I will focus on the "rhythm"/sound of your buttons being pressed, more than the virtual stick input.

As well another example with only the game sound.

If you miss any of the reloads, I suggest on the history checking the most recent input to review why could it have happened. For example you could have done the input `5H (SG.H) > 4 > 5H > 6` or very similarly `5H (SG.H) > 4H > 6`, where on both instances we pressed `Hardslash` too early.

## Sub-exercices

Very similarly to the previous sub example, we will be doing the input `5H>4>6H`, and meanwhile in the previous sub-example the focus was to get 2 5H shots, on this sub-exersice the goal is to get the second shot a bit after we have completed the input.
