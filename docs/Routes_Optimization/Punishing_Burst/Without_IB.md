### SG.S > Bridal

Simple. BnB

### SG.S remove stance > jc route

Simple n2. BnB but a bit more complex

### with Berry on hand

how is the timing?

should we SG.S > toss or raw toss?

## Corner

## AD j.SD |> c.S 

Something like `j.SPH` would be possible etc, but the combo would be more prorated/less flexible.

## AD j.SD |> 2H > Shotgun loops with pull extension

IB not required, but, IBing is waaay more reasonable/consistent.

Without IB you need to be higher, with IB you can be quite lower.

Recommended to j.S as soon as possible after AD and substantially delay j.D.

Nevertheless, this route is a showoff.
