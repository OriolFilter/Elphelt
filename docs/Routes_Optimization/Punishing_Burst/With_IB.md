!!! note "Heights and spacings are important."

    Everything only tested on Sol (or shown character) as an universal representative and/or weight

!!! info "`c.S > jc > j.S` or `j.S > jc`?"

    Both reach to de same damage, the difference being minimal (j.S starter routings reaching arround +1 more of damage than the c.S counterpart)

    See the same route with j.S starter:

Opponent is in the ground when decides to burst.

This section expects you to IB the burst.

# w Shotgun

## Midscreen

Same than without IB.

IB doesn't allow for "more routes", but gives us more margin to perform the "basic ones"

## Corner

? Probably on grounded bursts one is very limited unless you are close enough to wallsplat with just SG.IB > charge > SG.H 

# wo Shotgun

## Midscreen

### c.S

!!! success "Simple and Good"

c.S routes are overall simple, especially if close to the corner.

#### c.S > j.SPS > jc j.SPSHD

https://youtu.be/C7hhNXT6kPc

#### c.S > j.SPS > jc j.SPSHD > 2H > Bridal

If close enough to the corner/managed opponent's height correctly, you will be able to pick up j.D with 2H.

#### c.S > j.KSH > 2P > f.S > 5H > Genoverse

!!! warning "Not that good"

    This routing is not very good compared to the meterless ones, but can lead to substantial screen carry in comparison.

!!! warning "6H followup annoying"

    6H can be annoying due to opponent height, on mid and heavyweight characters (specially midweights) can just mean that you should not delay  6H, but on lightweights most surely will be an issue (untested)

### j.S > etc

!!! warning "Basic c.S routings are possible"

    j.S might be helpful on instances were you did IB the burst but are too high to fall get to the ground and press c.S

#### j.S > jc > j.KSH > 2P > f.S > 5H > Genoverse

!!! warning "6H followup annoying"

    6H can be annoying due to opponent height, on mid and heavyweight characters (specially midweights) can just mean that you should not delay  6H, but on lightweights most surely will be an issue (untested)

## Corner

### c.S

!!! success "Probably the best one"

    Simple, effective, very flexible in the routing and oki.

#### c.S > j.KSH |> 2H > 5P > c.S > j.7H 

https://youtu.be/6TmGBf86ETI

#### c.S > j.KSH |> 2H > Shotgun x4

!!! warning "Advanced"

### AD

#### AD j.KSD > j.Pull |> c.S 

Note the delays between the buttons to increase opponent's height.
