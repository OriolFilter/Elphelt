!!! note "Heights and spacings are important."

    Everything only tested on Sol (or shown character) as an universal representative and/or weight

!!! info "`c.S > jc > j.S` or `j.S > jc`?"

    Both reach to de same damage, the difference being minimal (j.S starter routings reaching arround +1 more of damage than the c.S counterpart)

Opponent is in the ground when decides to burst.

This section expects you to IB the burst.

# w Shotgun

## Midscreen

Same than without IB.

IB doesn't allow for "more routes", but gives us more margin to perform the "basic ones"

## Corner

? Probably on grounded bursts one is very limited unless you are close enough to wallsplat with just SG.IB > charge > SG.H 

# wo Shotgun

## land c.S > etc

## Midscreen

### c.S BNB

#### c.S > jKSH > 2P > f.S > 5H > Genoverse

!!! warning "6H followup annoying"

    6H can be annoying due to opponent height, on mid and heavyweight characters (specially midweights) can just mean that you should not delay  6H, but on lightweights most surely will be an issue (untested)

### j.S > etc

#### j.S > jc > jKSH > 2P > f.S > 5H > Genoverse

!!! warning "6H followup annoying"

    6H can be annoying due to opponent height, on mid and heavyweight characters (specially midweights) can just mean that you should not delay  6H, but on lightweights most surely will be an issue (untested)

### j.pull > j.PS > jc > etc

!!! warning "Joke routing"

    If you are 1 frame late, Sol reaches the ground.

    Requires to be quite high so you have enough time before reahcing the ground to do j.PS

    Good damage gotta be honest.

### j.pull > Airthrow

!!! warning "Joke routing"

    Idk it's funny.

    If you are going to use 50% meter you better use it on Genoverse... After all, what are you trying to do? Opponent doesn't have burst!

## Corner

### c.S

!!! success "Probably the best one"

    Simple, effective, very flexible in the routing and oki.

#### c.S > j.KSH |> 2H > Shotgun x4

https://youtu.be/khPb6evgg14

#### c.S > j.KSH |> 2H > 5P > c.S > j.7H 

https://youtu.be/6TmGBf86ETI

### j.S

#### j.S |> jc > KSH > 2H > Shotgun x5

One could do one single charged shotgun into SG.S Pull as an extender, but cannot do it on the second one.

https://youtu.be/wxJl6w11SS8

#### j.S |> c.S

!!! error "BAD"

    Pushback on c.S will make it very difficult to get something out of it, either do j.S jc or do c.S directly

https://youtu.be/1BKvzToxk8Y

### AD j.SD |> c.S

Something like `j.SPH` would be possible etc, but why would you do that.

https://youtu.be/Cl3xDco1yxw

### j.D

!!! warning "Height specific"

    j.D requires a minimum height in order for the move to be active before reaching the ground, so **probably it's not that useful**, yet the most damaging routes are reserved to it, especially the `j.D |> 2H routings`.

#### j.D |> 2H > Pull > c.S > sj9

!!! warning "Showoff"

    Quite "standard" route if we ignore the fact that needs has to do a forward superjump and delay some buttons.

Leads to decent damage.

#### j.D |> 2H > Shotgun

TODO

#### j.D > c.S

!!! info "Dash on landing for consistency"

    You might be able to fit a small dash startup once landing which helps in consistency.

https://youtu.be/MxsWF7lhWmA

### 2H

!!! error "Bad"

    In order to do 2H punish, one needs to do an extremely low j.IB, so it's the least consistent of all the routes.

    As well due to the initial proration from 2H, the reward is low.

    If you want to do the `j.7D dl. Toss setup` it's a bit annoying to do due to the null pushback making you stay very close to the corner/wall/opponent with the shotgun stance.
