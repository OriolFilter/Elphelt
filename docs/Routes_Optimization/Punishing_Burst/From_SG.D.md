!!! warning "Disclaimer"

    Timings/routes might very depending if there was a delay on the burst or not. This restriction is mostly caused by the berry timer.

!!! warning "Avoid SG.P as Starter"

    The damage will be heavily reduced in comparison to other starters.

# SG.D pull > SG.S (standard routing) 



## SG.S

### Punish with IB SG.Hx2 Toss (very tight)

Requires opponent to burst as soon as possible.

### Punish with IB SG.H SG.S Toss

On a real case scenario, **after the bridal do less charged SG.H**

The last shotgun requires you to be frameperfect, so it's hard.

## SG.H (1)

### Punish with SG.S SG.P Toss

Very simple.

### Punish with 66 SG.H 2P Toss (very tight)

This is mostly to show how limited/tight the options if we want to have a better starter (SG.H).

Probably doesn't work on all characters which will make it extra difficult/bad.

> If opponent delays the burst you won't be able to do this/berry will explode while tossing it.

### Punish with IB 66 SG.H SG.P Toss (very tight)

With IB we gain an extra edge, still very tight, but leads a bit more of damage than with SG.S

## SG.H (2)

!!! info "Burst Safe Distance"

    After the second shot, you are in a "burst safe" distance. Where if you block OS your hurtbox while in blocking animation will get within the burst area. But if you don't hold back/block/block OS, burst won't reach you.

    If we block burst here, I don't think we can get a reward/punish out of it.

### Punish with SG.S Toss (very tight)

You require of delaying SG.S to hit the opponent after the burst as soon as possible, otherwise berry will explode in your face.

> If opponent delays the burst you won't be able to do this/berry will explode while tossing it.

### Punish with RAW Toss

Very simple, better reward/damage than with SG.S
