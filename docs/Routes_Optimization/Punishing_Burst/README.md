# Punishing Burst


!!! note  "Pick a solid starter"

    Using the starter with less initial proration leads to more damage even if two routes look alike.

    During a match you can use "whatever" since you want to ensure getting a punish, even if it deals less damage, yet, on certain situations you have more margin to decide what you will start the combo with.
