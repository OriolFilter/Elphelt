# w Shotgun

If we do whatever into shotgun stance (ie. `5k > c.S > Shotgun stance`) and are able to react to the opponent doing burst, we might be able to backdash burst, if we do we can proceed with a punish.

Even if it's possible it's more of a flex more than anything, or if reacted to it while doing a RC.
