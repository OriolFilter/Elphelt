!!! warning "Joke routing"

    If you are 1 frame late, Sol reaches the ground.

    Requires to be quite high so you have enough time before reahcing the ground to do j.PS

    Good damage gotta be honest.

#### j.Pull > Airthrow

!!! warning "Joke routing"

    Idk it's funny.

    If you are going to use 50% meter you better use it on Genoverse... After all, what are you trying to do? Opponent doesn't have burst!

## Corner

### j.S

#### j.S |> jc > KSH > 2H > Shotgun x5

One could do one single charged shotgun into SG.S Pull as an extender, but cannot do it on the second one.

#### j.S |> c.S

!!! danger "BAD"

    Pushback on c.S will make it very difficult to get something out of it, either do j.S jc or do c.S directly

!!! warning "Showoff route"

    Kinda cool if you ask me

!!! info " "

    First j.KSH delay timings are quite specific, due to the low hitcount therefore low gravity, Sol can get out of range from j.H, so on this routing you focus on delaying j.K/S instead of the usual j.H.

### j.D

!!! warning "Height specific"

    j.D requires a minimum height in order for the move to be active before reaching the ground, so **probably it's not that useful**, yet the most damaging routes are reserved to it, especially the `j.D |> 2H routings`.

#### j.D > c.S

!!! info "Dash on landing for consistency"

    You might be able to fit a small dash startup once landing which helps in consistency.

#### j.D |> 2H > Pull > c.S > sj9

!!! warning "Showoff"

    Quite "standard" route if we ignore the fact that needs has to do a forward superjump and delay some buttons.

Leads to decent damage.

TODO

### 2H

!!! danger "Bad"

    In order to do 2H punish, one needs to do an extremely low j.IB, so it's the least consistent of all the routes.

    As well due to the initial proration from 2H, the reward is low.

    If you want to do the `j.7D dl. Toss setup` it's a bit annoying to do due to the null pushback making you stay very close to the corner/wall/opponent with the shotgun stance.
