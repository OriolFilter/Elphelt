# wo Shotgun

## Corner

## AD j.SD |> 2H > Shotgun loops with pull extension

IB not required, but, IBing is waaay more reasonable/consistent.

Without IB you need to be higher, with IB you can be quite lower.

Recommended to j.S as soon as possible after AD and substantially delay j.D.

Nevertheless, this route is a showoff.
