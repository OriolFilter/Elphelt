# Standard routes

## Comboing into Genoverse

Possible followups.

6H (Ender)

6H (Bridal |> Pickup)

6H (Bridal |> KD), if the opponent is quite high they might be abe to tech out, a workaround for this might be delaying the bridal.

### j.KSH |> (2P >) > (c.S) rejump

`j.KSH` can be perform by doing:

- Genoverse > IAD j.KSH
- Genoverse > 66 ~ j.9KSH


#### General Notes

> Notes:
>
> Depending on the height/distance whatever every single button from `j.KSH` will require some degree of delay, specially the `j.H`, since we are rising the height of the opponent (without getting that high that we can't combo), in order for us to land in the ground before the opponent and still have time to pickup with 2P or c.S.
>
> The damage difference without using `2P` is that low that it's recommended to pickup with `2P > c.S` for more stability/consistency.
>
> Against lightweights I believe `sj.IAD j.KSH` to be more consistent than `IAD j.KSH` (generally speaking).
>
> Stuff like IADs look cool, but as per the moment I cannot justify them over doing the `Genoverse > 66 ~ j.9KSH` except the extremely specific instance where I did `Genoverse > 66 ~ sj.9SH` and allowed for `j.D |> f.S > 5H > Bridal`.
>
> Being able to use IAD also depends on the proximity from the opponent, as being too close would result in dropping the combo (not being able to route j.KSH).

#### On not prorated combos

At very high distances `Genoverse > 66 ~ j.9SH` _can_ route into `j.D |> f.S/5H` Pickup, but no knockdown.

From `Genoverse > 66 ~ sj.IAD 9SH` I was able to get `j.D |> f.S > Bridal`, once. Since it's an IAD, requires some spacing... For reference, I believe it was on Johnny, nevertheless it's a simulation that resembles something that I would call as too much inconsistent, therefore if one is found in such situation, take the j.D knockdown, you can still do the `superjump IAD` stuff, but aiming to get the j.D knockdown, not picking up from that.

#### On prorated combos


> Notes:
>
> Both `IAD` (or `sj.IAD`) should be usable in prorated combo routes, as it's less likely that the opponent goes over your character due to combo gravity, nevertheless I also believe that all the instances that the `IAD` routing can be used, one cana also use the `66 j.9`, therefore for consistency/simplifying things ij recommend going for the `66 j.9` routing on all the main scenarios.
