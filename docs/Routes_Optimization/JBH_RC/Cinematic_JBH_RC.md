Raw `JBH > RC` allows for 2h pickup.

[Elpheltcord discussion reference](https://discord.com/channels/121387821977042945/121388142941962241/1304109654649077850)

**THIS IS INTENDED AS GUTSCRUSH COMBO/ROUTING**

!!! warning "Note about RC 2H pickup"

    After 2h its not possible (or atleast I couldn't manage to) do a `c.S > j.K`, only `j.P` or `j.S`.

    If I am not being slow, means that if you jump one frame late/press j.S a frame late, the opponent will be able to tech out.

!!! note "Additional notes"

    In the corner its not possible to do  bridal loops.

    Is not possible to do `c.S jc j.KSHD` in the corner due to pushback.


## jP Guts-crush route

`JBH |> 2H > Pull jc j.S > j.KSH j.Toss |> j.PPPPPPPP...`

On this example Sol is set to 30% HP, were he ends up at 8 hits away of dying.

With lightweights it's very hard to control weight due to the low amount of hits/combo gravity.

## Pseudo BnB Routing

This one is way **more inconsistent** than the one from above, maybe it's possible to do 6H roll remove shotgun jump ppppppp, but it's too inconsitent to bother with it.

It is possible to go for a left/right c.S after the opponent teches.

We can also end the combo at 6H Shotgun stance and charge shotgun to catch the opponent mashing.
