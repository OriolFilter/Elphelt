!!! note "Grammar references"

    When saying fastfall I meant using j.Bridal to land to the ground faster/earlier/cancel vertical rising momentum.

## Midscreen

### Basic/Simple routing

Do jbh(2) > RC > j.Bridal as fastfall.

Proceed with a c.S pickup into j.KSHD for a simple KD.

### j.Bridal Pull into BnB

Doing jbh(2) > RC > j.Bridal as fastfall method means you have enough time to pull berry and follow up with a c.S for her BnB.

!!! success "Good and simple"

    Maybe lightweights are a bit annoying to control height due to the low ammount of hits/gravity scaling.

## Corner

### SGH Loops

When the opponent is cornered we can do fastfall into `[SG.H]` loops, we can do 3 charged shotguns before going to pull berry.

!!! warning "mid (chances to occur are quite low)"

## Cornered

When you are the one **in** the corner.

### j.Bridal Pull into BnB SG.S Sideswitch 


`jBridal fastafall |> pull > BnB` and use SG.S to sideswitch.

We get **better oki this way** than if we don't sideswitch and decide to go for **fullscreen carry**

!!! success "Good and simple"

    Maybe lightweights are a bit annoying to control height due to the low ammount of hits/gravity scaling.

### Crossunder concept

!!! warning "bad"

#### Lightweights

*if we are fast enough* (aka not likely), we can do fastafall  > pull > crossunder c.S to sideswitch, proceed with the usual j.S jc j.KSH toss  then shotgun loops or whatever, should only be possible on lightweights

#### Mid/Heavyweights

Same from above but with midweights, instead of landing pull, dash pull, quite annoying to get anyway, so the routing is technically possible.

With heavyweights its also technically possible, but, due to the weight (duh), they are too low, so you need to increase their height, which makes it a bit more annoying.

## Others

### Heavies 2H pickup

On heavyweights we can do RC > fastfall > 2h. doing a small walkback before the 2h helps with consistency, this would include doing 2H > Shotgun loops in the corner

!!! success "Good"

### Other notes

Besides all of this one can just do j.Bridal fastfall > c.S jc etc which is much simpler. This includes in the corner c.S j.KSHD |> 2H.
