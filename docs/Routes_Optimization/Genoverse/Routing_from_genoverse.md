## 6H

### 6H > Bridal (ender)

+ Very simple

You can cancel 6H into berry or shotgun.

No video will be provided for this (use the video in [6H > Bridal > Pickup](#6h-bridal-pickup) for reference).

!!! Note "Bridal is height dependant"

    Bridal is height dependant, if the opponent is too high bridal might go under them.
    
    The workaround for this is to delay the bridal.

!!! Note "Beware of  long combos"

    If you want to do 6H with dash momentum, if the combo is too long the opponent might be able to tech before the 6H hits them.


### 6H > Bridal > Pickup

- Can be a bit tricky.

!!! Note "Bridal is height dependant"

    Bridal is height dependant, if the opponent is too high bridal might go under them.
    
    The workaround for this is to delay the bridal.

!!! Note "Beware of  long combos"

    If you want to do 6H with dash momentum, if the combo is too long the opponent might be able to tech before the 6H hits them.

### 6H > Genoverse

- Finisher/gutscrush.

If the 6H is spaced and the opponent is high, it will be burst-safe.

When they burst the 6H, Genoverse will whiff (on certain situations can still catch them), and you can punish the burst before they land.

## j.KSH |> pickup

### 66 j.9KSH

The j.K is not burstsafe.

After j.S hits and j.H are burstsafe.

!!! Warning "Delay j.K"

    To create a height difference between Elphelt and the opponentl, do j.K when she's close to start falling.

    **If this is not done, only j.H might be burstsafe.**

!!! Note "Potemkin"

    On Potemkin it is possible to make the j.K burstsafe but requires the combo length to be quite short.

### IAD / sj.IAD > j.KSH

!!! Note "j.KSH or j.PSH?"

    Both, both is good.

    I do j.KSH, both are valid.

    j.P raises the opponent a bit higher than with j.K.

    I rather delay the buttons when I want extra height.


Depending on the amount of hits and opponent height/weight you might need to do sj.IAD instead of an IAD. 

Spacing, hit count, height/weight makes you choose between IAD and **sj.**IAD, a rule of thumb would be:

- Low hitcount/Lightweights -> sj.IAD
- Heavyweight -> IAD

But other than that it's a bit of trial and error/feeling.

#### Roundstart 5H > Genoverse

On this specific scenario sj.IAD is required for Lightweights and Midweights.

#### High distance

This route can be used when there is a substantial distance.

# Corner

Notes specifically regarding the corner.

#TODO

## IAD j.SHD > c.S 


## Gutscrush

## On not prorated combos

(this is old text, will need to check it eventually)

At very high distances `Genoverse > 66 ~ j.9SH` _can_ route into `j.D |> f.S/5H` Pickup, but no knockdown.

From `Genoverse > 66 ~ sj.IAD 9SH` I was able to get `j.D |> f.S > Bridal`, once. Since it's an IAD, requires some spacing... For reference, I believe it was on Johnny, nevertheless it's a simulation that resembles something that I would call as too much inconsistent, therefore if one is found in such situation, take the j.D knockdown, you can still do the `superjump IAD` stuff, but aiming to get the j.D knockdown, not picking up from that.

# Special notes

- It's possible to connect Genoverse into 2H (ie. 6P > Genoverse > 2H).
  
- It's possible to route into an UB setup.
