Possible routings:

- c.S > j.9P

- Cooked iad berry toss > j.9S (some ~~tall~~ chars might allow j.H)  

## Concepts

Most of the time the situation that we are looking for is:

c.S > 6P?? -> shouldn't be able to combo from 

c.S > 2D

Then we can mix it up a bit until we go for the `j.9P` as a possible "instant overhead" (not that instant if we go from c.S but w/e)

> Note:\
> Still requires the c.S to be blocked standing.

### From j.D > Pull

c.S > Toss > c.S > Smix

### Others

Requires 50% meter.

j.D YRC could be used for similar smixes

### set 1 (f.S > 2D > IAD j.H > j.Toss)

#### IAD j.H > j.Toss > 2D (low)

> j.H > j.Toss > 2D is a true blockstring

If they IB j.H > Button they get hit, but they could place a backdash/blitz/reversal, probably it's a 1 frame gap.

If they IB berry they cannot press before 2D becomes active.

Should end in berry shot to avoid having to hitconfirm + on block you have shotgun pulled out

#### IAD j.H > j.Toss > 6P (slow high)

> j.H > j.Toss > 6P is a true blockstring

If they IB j.H > Button they get hit, but they could place a backdash/blitz/reversal, probably it's a 1 frame gap.

If they IB berry they can throw you.

#### IAD j.H > j.Toss > c.S > 2D (delayed low)

> j.H > j.Toss > c.S > 2D is a true blockstring

It's very much a bit of mix and match.

On block you have shotgun pulled out, yet due to pushback one will be fairly far.

#### IAD j.H > j.Toss > c.S > 6P (delayed high)

> 6P won't be a true blockstring therefore they can blitz/press

If they IB j.H > Button they get hit, but they could place a backdash/blitz/reversal, probably it's a 1 frame gap.

Can still catch the Berry Explosion like???!

Low profile moves might fuck Elphelt (Scum dipper, Sol Grand Viper, Venom 2D...)

Some Low profile moves, such as Sol 2D won't work, Ky 2D will trade.

#### IAD j.H > j.Toss > j.9S (fast high)

> j.H > j.Toss > j.9S is a true blockstring

If they IB j.H > Button they get hit, but they could place a backdash/blitz/reversal, probably it's a 1 frame gap.

If they IB berry j.S won't be an f-shiki.

Pick up with c.S  -> 2H re-jump route and decide ender (tho extending more might be hard and inconsistent).

#### IAD j.H > j.Toss > SG.D

https://fireshare.fihome.xyz/w/5c295d5c077f8c5983cb4392fead9e6a

#### IAD j.H > j.Toss > c.S > SG

Aimed towards setting pressure afterward.

### Set 2 (f.S > IAD j.Toss)

#### IAD j.Toss > c.S > j.9P (fast high)

> j.Toss > c.S > j.9S is a true blockstring

If they IB Berry they can't press before c.S comes out.

If they IB c.S, then j.P won't be an f-shiki.

#### IAD j.Toss > 2D

> j.Toss > c.S > j.9S is a true blockstring

If they IB Berry they can't press before 2D comes out.

#### IAD j.Toss > c.S > 2D 

> j.Toss > c.S > j.9S is a true blockstring

If they IB Berry they can't press before c.S comes out.

https://fireshare.fihome.xyz/w/f443024d1b6b784272807327379da5e1

#### IAD j.Toss > 6P 

SG.H will be throwable

https://fireshare.fihome.xyz/w/e69ea7115335decd6eb39d7a13529c26

#### IAD j.Toss > c.S > 6P

Some low profiles might slip.

Also very fast horizontal reaching buttons.
