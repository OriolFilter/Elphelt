Usually, after shooting berry with `SG.H` this will be the standard routes.

Combo gravity as well of opponent height and weight take a big factor when doing this routes.

# SG.S > c.S > jc

Do SG.S > remove shotgun and proceed with a standard c.S > jc routing

## Midweights



## Heavyweights



# SG.S > Bridal

Do SG.S > Bridal

Depending on the opponent height and weight, SG.S and/or bridal will need to be substantially delayed.

If close to the corner/in the corner one might be able to extend the combo with bridal loops.

Unless the shotgun is charged (or able to combo), doing an additional SG.H is most likely to cause the opponent to airtech, so not recommended.

## Midscreen

Simple route.

SG.S > Bridal

!!! Warning "Manual delays involved"

    You might need to delay the SG.S and/or Bridal depending on the opponent height/spacing.

## Corner

In the corner we can follow up with SG.P or SG.H, from there pick up respectively with "whatever".

Generally speaking you will eventually choose between bridal or jumpcancel routes.

### c.S jc

Probably the most consistent route among the others

### Lightweights

Unlike the other weights, on lightweights you are able to route into charged shotgun, as long the starter number of hits within the combo stays very low.

#### Low number of hits

From 1 to 4. 3 if we consider whatever > toss (hit / +1) > SG.H

#### Bigger number of hits

In the scenario you are no longer able/confident to get charged shot, you should pick one of the **standard routes**, the `c.S jc` routing being the most stable one (generally speaking).

# Double SG.S

Mostly leads into SG.H or Bridal, requires to be horizontally spaced, so you don't end up sideswitching with the opponent.

Mostly done from raw hit, since from combo it's hard due to the spacing required, although weights are also taken into consideration.

Might require of manual delays to reduce the opponent height is a bit lower.

Might also require to delay the bridal followup, although this might be mostly with Lightweights.

### SG.S > SG.S > Bridal

### SG.S > SG.S > 2P jc

On lightweights, if the combo does have very low hits, we can cancel the second SG.S with removing the shotgun stance, then pickup with 2P into c.S/f.S (mostly likely will be f.S), following it up with a jump cancel into whatever.
