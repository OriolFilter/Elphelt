!!! warning "USELESS TECH"
    
    This tech is useless.


!!! note "Concept"

    This is mostly a concept and nothing else.


If we shoot the berry with SG.H, we are able to fit an IAD j.P.

On Midweights and heavyweights is more stable.

On lightweights instead, unless you are in the corner where you might be able to do something like IAD j.PSD, it's not possible to get something out of it.

Maybe on May it's possible to IAD j.PP dl.H, but that's besides the point.

Everything tested has been done **MIDSCREEN** meaning that in the corner it's **very likely** that routing into `j.D > 2H` or `j.D > 2P/c.S/f.S` are possible.

Nevertheless, don't do this.

# Lightweights

Tested on Milia, couldn't get anything.

Should apply to **most** of the Lightweights, but if they are horizontally wide enough it might be possible to do something exactly like the May routing.

I am assuming (but not tested) Ram and Dizzy on top of my mind right now. 

## May

IAD j.PSH > 2P works on May

### Funny IAD j.PSD Corner IK

!!! note "Technically optimal"

    If you can get an IK with that starter, it's optimal.

    Drawbacks being painful to execute, even more when we take into account that you should ever never do this routing so how you gonna land it with no practice.
