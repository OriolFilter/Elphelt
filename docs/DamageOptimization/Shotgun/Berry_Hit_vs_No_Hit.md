# Berry Hit vs No Hit

Which is the impact/damage overall reduction?

The following `SG.D` combo made [185 damage without the berry hit](https://youtu.be/NwHo9cRwiws) vs [174 **with** the berry hit](https://youtu.be/tPFZmveH_Qg) on sol at 100% HP.

!!! into "Combo used to test:"

    SG.D > Pull > [SG.H]x3 > Toss > [SG.H]x4 (with wallsplat) > [SG.H]x2 (**without** wallsplat)

As a tip, doing micro-walks can help fixing both distance and work as a framekill to facilitate the timing/reducing the "manual delay" needed.
