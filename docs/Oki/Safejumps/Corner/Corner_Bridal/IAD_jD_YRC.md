# j.D YRC

Solves the issue that [#iad-pull-js](IAD_jPull_jS.md) has, it being "how to deal vs blitz".

Why is j.D YRC "safe" from blitz? YRC has 2 invulnerable frames, since j.D YRC is a projectile, it will hit opponent blitz, and if timed correctly, you won't be rejected because you will be in one of those 2 invulnerable frames from YRC.

Due to the high blockstun it enables for true blockstring into 6P, although afterward doesn't seem to lead to anything on block...

## Confirms

### c.S j.SPSH Toss Shotgun

Confirming j.D into 66 c.S helps with proximity/distance consistency.

### 2H Charged Shotgun

Still tight due to 2H into charged shots.

Lightweights might be an issue.

Requires a slight delay after the first charged SG.H, otherwise the opponent will tech out too early.

### Charged Shotgun UB

- UB setup

Requires adjustments per weight.

### Charged Shotgun Loops

- You get a 6H ender.
- Very consistent (to the exception to the first shotgun which can be quite tight)

#### Concept of more damage

Don't let the berry hit the opponent before the explosion. Aka delay shotgun shots as much as possible.

The damage is not meaningful anyway so don't bother  with it.
