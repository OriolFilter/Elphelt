### quick notes

will eventually take a look at what's there.

```text
may feels a lot tighter than other chars.

millia also annoying.

Faust doesn't work (too low, no j.P/j.S/j.H)

venom j.S > j.H won't work on blockstring, but if j.S hits there is no need to RC

axl j.S > j.H won't work on blockstring, but if j.S hits there is no need to RC
```
