Very limited options, even with meter. Due to her low height I don't think it's possible to do `j.Toss > Land > RC > j.S/H`.     |

!!! warning "IAD j.KS > jToss > Land > RC"

    When going for IAD j.KS > jToss > Land > RC. It's important to slightly delay either tossing (better), or RC, so the berry its located at a lower height. This helps with consistency on characters with smaller hurtbox (normally/during hitstun), such as Millia or Answer.
 

!!! danger "9j.S vs 9j.H"
 
    In some characters besides of 9j.S, 9j.H can also hit/fshiki the opponent, yet it would still force us to use RC to get something out of it (aka chain with berry).

    Can technically be used to mix timings, but it's substantially slower therefore more reactable.

!!! info "If 9j.S combos into j.H, you can autopilot any standing hit into that routing without need of confirming."

## Alternatives

Some characters feel quite more limited than others, so there is a couple suggestions per character.

After j.Toss (if blocked), landing > 6H is a true blockstring.

After j.Toss (if blocked), landing > 6H > Bridal is a true blockstring that leaves us substantially plus. (need to check the numbers)
