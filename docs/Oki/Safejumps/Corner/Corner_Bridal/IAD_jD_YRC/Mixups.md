# Regarding j.S / j.D YRC

You want to do j.S as a way to condition the opponent/continue your pressure/bait stuff.

j.S is NOT a mixup.

If the opponent is consistently blocking j.S, you can proceed with the j.D YRC.

In order to have a mixup after j.D YRC we need the opponent to block standing.

Once the opponent blocks j.D YRC standing, it opens for fuzzy setups.

## pending to sort.

### Crouching opponent

6P/delayed 2D mixups

### Standing opponent

```
IAD j.Toss |> 2K # Mid Low

IAD j.S > j.Toss |> 2K # High Low

IAD j.K > j.S > j.Toss |> 2K     # High High Mid Low

IAD j.K > j.S > j.H     # High High High -> if any of them connects, on landing we can c.S > Toss for combo

IAD j.K > j.S > j.Toss |> 2K   # High High Mid Low

IAD j.K > j.S > j.Toss |> j9.S (fshiki) > YRC    # High High Mid High -> Doesn't lead to anything (**unless we YRC**)

IAD j.K > j.S > j.Toss |> j9.S (fshiki) > YRC    # High High Mid High -> Doesn't lead to anything (**unless we YRC**)

IAD j.K > j.S > j.Toss |> j9.S (fshiki) > j.H   # High High Mid High
```

Don't work:

```
IAD j.S > j.Toss |> j9.S (fshiki won't connect/work)

IAD j.K > j.S > j.Toss |> j9.S (fshiki won't connect/work)

IAD j.K > j.S > j.Toss |> j9.P > YRC (cannot combo into berry explosion)
```


!!! note

    j.Toss can lead either to high/low with 6P/2D on landing (2K in case of going for the "fast" low, 2D for the delayed/late one).

    j.Toss can lead to fshiki when the timer is less to 1 second.

    j.K > Toss is not real.
