### Jo 2S > 2H

#### If you IB Jo 2S doing a 5P will trade with 2H at best, not good risk reward.

- Trades (at best)
- Tight
- Risky

##### if you FD Jo 2S 2H will wiff

2H whiffs so sounds like the

### Coin > 2S

`!2,3,6H,5*14,2S*3`

Let him ruin the economy

It close enough (aka on his face, coin will whiff therefore you have a free hit wit 2P, 2S or 2D, 2H technically could work but quite tight and most surely will lose to throw, `JO` could also panic RC, so you give them less window that way)

## Use 6H

Kidiot words:

> It's a 10f active move that removes her hurtbox on startup, kills the opponent on hit, and anti airs

## Sniper fullscreen

Kidiot words:

> I (don't) really care too much if you're just sitting there sniping against me while I have close to full health, which happens quite often
> The risk reward really is not very good for you there, I think
