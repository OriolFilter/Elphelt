# Fullscreen Sniper CH

## Kire Pull Berry 

### Midscreen

Both due to timing (button active a frame late), and distance (too far away from hitting Venom).

## IAD j.Pull > j.Toss

If we open the opponent with the meaty, we can follow up with Bridal.

Other than that, there is no mix besides the 50/50 if the opponent wants to Blitz.
