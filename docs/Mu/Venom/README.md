### 6H CH

Standard 6H CH Kyouse routing won't work.

It can work if you do superjump IAD instead.

On hitbox with Up SOCD cleaning you can do `[Down] > [Right] + [Up] > ]Down[ > ]Down[ + ]Right[ + ]Up[ (aka release everything, go back to 5) > Right`

### Don't

Don't do 5k > c.S > f.S > 2D, it's prone to missing if one don't have enough dash momentum and hit pointblank

Jump, 6P will kill you.

If you get 6Pd, mash out of it, it's hard to combo without a CH.

## Neutral

### Sniper / Shotgun

Use sniper to deal with Venom setting balls, use the CH opportunity to runup -> pressure or pull berry and throw it while cutting distance.

IT works fullscreen:

On sniper CH -> perfect reload -> SG.H -> Pull berry -> runup meaty oki with SG.P.


SG.H can deal with **small** balls, you can do runnup SG.H.

On sniper, mix switching to SG.H to block/shot balls.

And roll to go over balls.


Geno verse also destroy small balls.

### Stuff

Venom 6P Beats Elphelt IAD j.Whatever.

Elphelt superjump IAD j.K can go over Venom 6P, but you won't get anything.

2H will go under: 5P, 5H, 5S, 6P, **6H if Elp 2H was done at the same timing/slightly earlier**.

Use 2D to Venom's 2D recovery frames. 5K will whiff or clash. 2K, 2S loose against Venom 2D (even when trying to punish it), f.S also looses/whiffs. If substantially spaced 6H will beat it and get a juicy counterhit  





## Oki

### Wake-up DA 

If close enough you can challenge DA with jbh.

Standard Dark Angel is throwable (if close enough) and "can be hit":

- If you do **jbh** at the first frame possible after the super flash, you will be able to get the first hit on Venom into the animation.

- If you are off by 1 frame, you will hit Venom with the later frames, still good scenario.

Burst Dark Angel has more invulnerable frames frames, meaning:

- If you do **jbh** at the first frame, **jbh** will completely whiff.

- If you delay **jbh** slightly, it will hit Venom in later frames.

- Throw is not an option.
