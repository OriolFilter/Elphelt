IDK how to fill this up

# Don'ts

Don't jump forward, you big dumdum, you have no meter to FD venom 6P

# 2S

IB it, block it, backdash it, don't jump it.

You can jump backdash, but you are giving screen and putting yourself in the corner vs a fullscreen venom while both of you are full hp so he has no reason to take riskier approaches or to even approach in the first place.

You as well don't have meter to threaten properly with sniper, so again, venom is not in a bad spot.


## 2S > 2D

Used mostly to contest IB/Block > 2H.

If you press 6H after blocking 2S you get a CH.

## 2S > Stinger Aim

(ball that shoots at you)

### Stinger Aim S

We can IAD j.KSH etc, even if we got CH by 2S.

It is also possible to do IAD j.KS dl j.D |> f.S 5Hx5

### Stinger Aim H

If we **IB** 2S, we can 2H under the ball, and get a CH with 2H(2), can either continue with berry pull > etc, or a simple f.S 5H Bridal

## fS

2H goes under.

2S trades.

f.S/5h looses.

5K Wins

6P looses unless venom is 1f late which.

Microwalk 5P trades or looses, depends on if you have been late or not (very hard for no reward).

## Carcass Raid

Commonly used to counter your roundstart 2H.

f.S in roundstart leads to CH -> IAD combo.

2S/5H can be used too, yet less reward.
