# Roundstart

## TLDR

Use f.S or 2D to beat all the **ground** options (if one doesn't the other does).

### Elphelt Buttons notes:

#### Elphelt's f.S

Doesn't punish backdash, but it's still a win since we get free space for our neutral game.

##### Wins

- 6P, only **wins** if Elphelt uses a followup (`f.S > 5H` or `f.S > Bridal`).

- 2K wins but non-counterhit, can't get anything from it.

- Everything except the listed under.

##### Trades

- 5K

##### Loses

- 6P if Elp didn't chain a followup.
- H DP.
- Leo's S DP (trades), yet if Leo got hit standing instead of airborne, Leo scores advantage due the KD. If Elp delays the f.S 4-5 frames, she can get a CH.

#### Elphelt's 2D

Used to cover instances that Elp f.S doesn't win.

##### Relevant Wins

- 5K, meanwhile Elp f.S trades.
- Allows punishing Leo's 2K unlike with Elp f.S
- Whiffs against Leo's S DP.
- 1/2 Frames delayed 2D whiffs against Leo's H DP, otherwise clashes.

##### Trades

N/A

##### Loses

- f.S (2D loses and get poked, Leo can only follow it up by 214S.)
- 2D (loses to Elp f.S)

##### Irrelevant whiffs/clashes

> Whiff/clashes and doesn't allow for punish or anything relevant.

- 6P (whiffs, loses to Elp f.S)
- 2H (clash, loses to Elp f.S)
- H DP (clash)
- H DP (whiff, Elp 2D is delayed for 1-2 frames)
- 2S (clash, loses to Elp f.S)
- 2D (whiffs, still can be blocked, loses to Elp f.S)

## Leo's 6P

Something like `f.S > Bridal` or `f.S > 5H` works.

2D whiffs.

## Leo's 6K

Loses to f.S and 2D, didn't bother about anything else.

## Leo's 5K

f.S/2S trades

5H loses.

6H hits too late, doesn't get a CH, cancel into whatever **but not bridal**.

6P hits too late, can be blocked.

2D wins.

delayed 2k wins, aka ~ 2k>f.S>etc

delayed 2d wins, aka ~ 2D > bridal / shotgun / berry

## Leo's f.S

f.S wins.

2D loses and get poked, Leo can only follow it up by 214S.

5P loses.

5H loses.

6H loses.

on IB can do 5H, but if Leo does `f.S > 5H` ur fucked.

6P "hits" as long doesn't go into stance, also hits if Leo does `f.S > 5H`.

## Leo's 2H

6H Clashes, if Leo delays the 2H you get murdered, so discard this option.

2H loses.

f.S wins/gets CH.

2D clashes.

**1 frame delayed Elp f.S murders you.**

**3-4 frame delayed Elp f.S scores a CH.**

## Leo's delayed 2H

Reminder, Elp 6H murders you. Don't.

## Leo's 2K

2D gets a CH, slightly delayed (1/2 frames) 2D also gets a CH, further delay will whiff, still safe tho.

f.S wins, no CH, can't get anything out of it due to distance. I dont like the idea of pulling shotgun against leo in neutral anyway.

## Leo's 2S

2D clashes.

5K clashes.

f.S wins with a CH.
## Leo's 6H

f.S/2S gets CH.

Delayed 2D gets CH.

6H get CH.

6P gets CH.

2H gets CH.

substantially delayed 5K gets CH.

## Leo's 2D

f.S/2S wins.

2K/5K/2P/5P/2D/6H/5H/Bridal loses.

## Leo's S DP

f.S, yet if Leo got hit standing instead of airborne, Leo scores advantage due the KD.

If Elp delays the f.S 4-5 frames, she can win with an airborne CH.

**2D Whiffs.**

2S loses.


6H Trades.

5H/Bridal loses.

Bridal also whiffs (does it even matter??).


## Leo's H DP

2S/f.S/5H/6H/Bridal loses.

2D clashes.

**1/2 frames delayed 2D wiffs.**

## Leo's Erst

Loses to everything except 6H/6P/Bridal?.

## Leo's Zweit

Loses to everything except 6H?/6P/Bridal?

## Leo's TK Siegesparade

f.S/5H/6H/6P wins

Other might whiff.

## Leo's Backdash

Delayed 5H hits bd.

6H hits bd.

Bridal hits bd.
