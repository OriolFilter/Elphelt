This is me testing for stuff or stuff tested that's "not bueno".

## Punishes


### Bandit bringer

It's possible to jump IB it and airthrow.

To get something out of it you need to RC unless there is a berry right under you.

Deals 55 damage which can kill sol at 5% HP.

Ground throw does the exact same damage, and it's easier to perform/less risky.
