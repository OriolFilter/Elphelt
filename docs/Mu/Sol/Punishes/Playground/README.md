This is me testing for stuff or stuff tested that's "not bueno".

## Punishes


### Bandit bringer

It's possible to jump IB it and airthrow.

To get something out of it you need to RC unless there is a berry right under you.

Deals 55 damage which can kill sol at 5% HP.

Ground throw does the exact same damage, and it's easier to perform/less risky.

#### Pull Berry

- Too technical
- Too finicky

> Toss Berry (hits) > SG.H > IAD j.PSH > 2P > c.S > j.SPSHD

### SG.S > [SG.H]

Simple but you need to time SG.S with Sol touching the ground or being close to do so.

Leads to less damage than [SG.PPP... > SG.H](../Ground_Viper.md#sgppp--sgh).

!!! Error "Bad safejump"

    Allows for safejump, but no reward on hitting the opponent.

    You can do something similar to `j.S |> f.S > 2H > 2D > Toss` or `j.S |> f.S > 2H > Toss`, but after that the opponent will be able to tech/block.
