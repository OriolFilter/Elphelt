## 5P

Do either `5P > 5H*5` or `5P > 5H > Bridal`. The latter requires Sol to not be very high and quite close to Elphelt.

!!! success "Safe and simple, with small reward"

## f.S

If Sol is close enough, you can do `CH f.S > 2H > Pull`, but that requires Sol to be uncomfortably close

!!! success "Good and simple"

### f.S Trade

On trade, you an either do `raw Bridal`, or do `5H > Bridal`

https://youtu.be/gt2ZbPiiw5s

## 5H

CH 5H will cause a hard knockdown, so we can go for:

- `5H > Bridal`

- `5H > Pull`

- `5H > SG Stance`

!!! success "Good and simple when there is some time to react"

!!! note "5H*5 for more damage?"

    Meanwhile `5H*5` is possible to use to deal a bit more of damage, it's negligible with Bridal. `5H*4` will do a knockdown, but deal the same damage as bridal and the knockdown will bw rose.

### 5H Trade

On trade, you cannot take nothing out of it, although still does the hard knockdown.


## 2P

https://youtu.be/6LmZNf-J5jo

!!! Warning "Doable but 2H would be better"

## 2S

It's somewhat usable but f.S has less range.

When close to Sol, the 2H pickup is more reliable.

## 2H

If done **too early** will trade with Sol, but can be picked up with c.S

If done **too late** will hit Sol when reaching the ground.

!!! success "Low risk with good reward"

## 6P

If you are very late with the 6P Sol will hit the ground and will be able to throw you.

https://youtu.be/p8Rk81XH4fI

!!! success "Very safe"

## 6H

https://youtu.be/km4aQJ_8sYQ

!!! note "A bit risky"

### 6H Trade

## SG.S

SG.S has little margin of not trading with Sol.

https://youtu.be/e_bLCJ0IGXY

!!! error "SG.H is much safer"

## SG.H / [SG.H]

Just shoot the Sol before he reaches you.

!!! success "Good and Simple"

## Bridal

**Bridal looses**

## Genoverse

Can be used, but since Riot Stamp clearly looses to some buttons, not recommended.

Technically can be used to beat Riot Stamp > RC Blitz, but if the opponent decides to burn 75% meter for you to press a button, who are we to stop them from doing that.
