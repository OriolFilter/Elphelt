## 5P

Do either `5P > 5H*5` or `5P > 5H > Bridal`. The latter requires Sol to not be very high and quite close to Elphelt.

## f.S

If Sol is close enough, you can do `CH f.S > 2H > Pull`, but that requires Sol to be uncomfortably close

### f.S Trade

On trade, you an either do `raw Bridal`, or do `5H > Bridal`

## 5H

CH 5H will cause a hard knockdown, so we can go for:

- `5H > Bridal`

- `5H > Pull`

- `5H > SG Stance`

### 5H Trade

On trade, you cannot take nothing out of it, although still does the hard knockdown.

## 2P

## 2S

It's somewhat usable but f.S has less range.

When close to Sol, the 2H pickup is more reliable.

## 2H

If done **too early** will trade with Sol, but can be picked up with c.S

If done **too late** will hit Sol when reaching the ground.

## 6P

If you are very late with the 6P Sol will hit the ground and will be able to throw you.

## SG.S

SG.S has little margin of not trading with Sol.

## SG.H / [SG.H]

Just shoot the Sol before he reaches you.

## Bridal

**Bridal looses**

## Genoverse

Can be used, but since Riot Stamp clearly looses to some buttons, not recommended.

Technically can be used to beat Riot Stamp > RC Blitz, but if the opponent decides to burn 75% meter for you to press a button, who are we to stop them from doing that.
