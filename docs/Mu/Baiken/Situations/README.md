## Blockstring into Kabari (S/H)

- Blitz, it exists


> Example string:\
> 5K > f.S > 5H > Kabari S \
> or
> 5K > f.S > 5H > Kabari H


IB superjump forward FD, it's tricky, but can allow for avoiding both Kabaris



## (Suzuran) Rokkon

Rokkon is -2, it's very risky to mash there since it's a good place for Baiken to press Azami, even super (although a bit pyscho to do).

On IB is -6, meaning we can punish with:

- 2P
- 2K
- 5P

Cant with:

- 5K is 7 Frames
- c.S is not possible due to being outside of range.
