# Defense?

Block glide > FD normal buttons / c.S once in the ground

# Neutral?

Slow/commital buttons like 6H feel very meh, since raven can just dash through them

5H is very risky without meter since raven can just 2h on block/whiff

# Stuff

2H > Scratch at lvl 3 (Max exc) is a true blockstring (can be dalyedo)
