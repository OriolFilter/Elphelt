## Shotgun Spacing

SG.H somewhat spaced is a nightmare for Jam.

It feels like the sweet spot is slightly at the end of Jam's 2S, since it means that if she wants to press doesn't have a fast reaching low (aka, you can hold the OS block) and she can't jump for free because SG.H still will catch her.
