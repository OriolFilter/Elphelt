### Dealing with buttons




#### Under Pressure

Options after UP:

- It's late
- Throw/Bite reset
- DoT


##### Under Pressure > It's Late

- Move is throw invulnerable
- On hit Slayer gets no real reward other than a reset (unless has meter)
- On CH you die.

Without IB
c.S Trades
2P Wins

Loekkson said that on jump FD it could enable instant overhead.

##### Under Pressure > DoT

- Invulnerable starter super that hits frame 0 (therefore you need to hold 4 _block_ before the super animation occurs).
- Don't need FD to be blocked in the air.


- Superjump > FD dodges it.
- Late Superjump > FD blocks it and allows for landing into CH punish.

##### Under Pressure > Bite/Throw

- On hit Slayer gets no real reward other than a reset (unless has meter), with bite **you need to mash out of stagger tho!**.

##### Under Pressure > 2K

- Low, hits at frame 8

Without IB
c.S Trades
2P Wins

On IB

c.S Trades
2P Wins
5K Wins
2D Wins (very tight, 1 frame late trades, 2 frame late loses)

##### Under Pressure > BDC ?

## Deffense

Jump/backdash seems to be the main options??

https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2135654058?t=02h26m17s

BrandonTheAsian9000:no blocking
BrandonTheAsian9000:backdash beats meaty low and high
BrandonTheAsian9000:jump beats crossup and grab
BrandonTheAsian9000:that way, you can still rps without being in counterhit state
BrandonTheAsian9000:and you think about 2 options instead of 4
