# Mapa

## P Mappa

Only punishable on Shotgun stance **AND** IB.

On Block is `-1`, on IB `-5`, but .

### w. Shotgun IB

- While using Shotgun stance **AND** IBing the attack.

If we have IBd Mappa, we can stuff a `SG.P` **If we are close enough** to hit Slayers arm, then chain into `SG.H`, it's also quite tight.

If we are not extremely close or don't want to do a tight `SG.P`, just `SG.H` from midrange to poke them.

## K Mappa

### w.o Shotgun IB

You will need to IB the hit.

> 5P > f.S > 5H > Bridal

Not punisheable at peak range as `5P` won't reach Slayer.

### IB JBH

Close enough we can fit a `Judge Better Half` or it's burst version, I repeat, **close enough**.

Can't recommend using that.
