# 2H

## w.o Shotgun

### c.S / f.S

We can use `f.S` as long Slayer 2H was not made at peak range.

If close enough we can start the combo with c.S.

Ibing Slayer's 2H will facilitate the timing of landing f.S.

## w. Shotgun

If the opponent is close enough we can `SG.P > SG.H`.

At all ranges we can `SG.H`.

Ibing Slayer's `2H` will facilitate the timing of landing `SG.P` or `SG.H`.
