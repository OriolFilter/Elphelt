### w.o Shotgun

- IBing will facilitate the timing, but it's not required, certainly facilitates everything.
- Dash momentum and being point-blank spacing with slayer is required if `2S` will be used in the combo, as otherwise `2D` will wiff, therefore, if not sure if the conditions are met, just skipp 2S altogether.
- We can also throw for sideswap (or metered throw corner combo)

The base route would be as:
> 66 > c.S > f.S > (2S >) 2D

After 2D we can Bridal, pulling a berry, throwing `Genoverse`, air-pulling berry, getting into Shotgun stance, etc.

Still, if we intend to use `Genoverse` or `Roman Cancel` to extend the combos, I suggest to remove the `2S` and for `Genoverse` specifically I would also remove `2D`.

Genoverse:

> 66 > c.S > f.S > Genoverse > Stuff

RC:

> 66 > c.S > f.S > 2D > RC > Stuff

non-dash momentum or point blank spacing:

> 66 > c.S > f.S > 2D > ender

#### Bridal

> 66 > c.S > f.S > (2S >) 2D > Bridal

#### Berry Pull

We can also replace `Bridal` for `Berry Pull`, this might be preferred to do in the corner.

> 66 > c.S > f.S > (2S >) 2D > Pull Berry

#### Throw RC

After the throw, the combo would be:

> RC > 236K or 236H > charge shotgun > [SG.H]x3 > charge shotgun > SG.S > 236P > [SG.H]x3 > SG.S > berry toss > charge shotgun > SG.S > [SG.H] > 6H > 236P

### w. Shotgun

## w. Shotgun IB Corner

- Very tight.
- Needs to be **VERY** close to the corner.
- Quite meme since it's quite tight and corner proximity is required.

> [SG.H], [Charge Shotgun] > SG.S > Pull Berry > [SG.H]x3 > [Charge Shotgun] > SG.S > High Berry Toss > [SG.H]x3 > 6H

# Crosswise Heel

Depending on the distance on which IBs `Crosswise Heel` it might allow for a better punish. Doesn't make much difference without IBing.

After IBing the second hit of `Crosswise Heel`, before inputting `c.S`, slightly delay the move, otherwise f.S will be triggered.

As well, it's recommended that after IBing the second hit of `Crosswise Heel`, do a microwalk forward to facilitate `c.S` connecting. This slightly improves consistency.

I am not able to consistently score a counterhit without IBing, which would allow for better routes on non-ib.

## Far hit

From a far hit there isn't much to cash in.

Go with some corner carry string and call it a day.

We can still RC to extend the combo, or Genoverse.

> f.S > 5H > Bridal

### Close IB

Generic c.S Antiair Counterhit BnB

> CH c.S ~ 2H > 236P > c.S > j.S > jc > j.K > j.S > j.H ~ j.toss |> 6H > 236H > (walk in >) SG.S > 236H > j.KSHD | j.SPSHD > j.236P

## Corner

### Corner Close IB

- Require proximity to the corner
- Quite tight

> CH c.S > 2H > 236H > [SG.H], [Charge Shotgun] > SG.S > Pull Berry > [SG.H]x3 > [Charge Shotgun] > SG.S > High Berry Toss > [SG.H] > 6H

### Corner w. Shotgun Close

More or less a BnB routing.

> CH SG.H > SG.S > Bridal > SG.H > c.S > j.K > j.S > j.H > j.D > j.236P

https://youtu.be/T8rDc2ZAWLw

### Corner w. Shotgun Close Bridal Loops

Same as above, changing the ender to Bridal loops.

> CH SG.H > SG.S > Bridal > SG.H > c.S > 5H > Bridal > (2P >) > c.S > 5H > Bridal > (2P >) > c.S > 5H > Bridal

https://youtu.be/J_sBuYvu2Os

### Corner w. Shotgun Close IB

Same route as the [non IB one](#corner-w-shotgun-close), but IBing might facilitate having a better height for 5H knockdown.

> CH SG.H > SG.S > Bridal > SG.H > c.S > j.K > j.S > j.H > j.D |> 5H > 236P

## Outspaced

Basically the move wiffs because you are too far away, this is your moment to shine
