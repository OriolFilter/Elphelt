OS IB her f.s 3h timings

her 6k ain't plus and you can IB second hit

there are no lows after blocking 5h so stand tf up

Become very familiar with blocking jacko 5d/6k on reaction or you will get smoked in this matchup as you will regularly have to block 6k and 5d during clock up with heaps of visual noise distractions.

You are forced to play actively on defense (abare 2s, bd, fuzzy jump) due to 6d being unreactable and can tend to jump over 2p. Yes you can and should still abare 2p just due to it being faster but be aware.

If you get otg'd you can tech forward and challenge multiple house placements/22d with AD j.d yrc. If she does not set a house then beware of 6h CH.

You can safe meaty jacko 2d with 5k but you need to lab this as it is a 2f window iirc. You can also meaty spaced 2d and it should make her dp whiff.

You need to play this matchup much more aggressively than you normally would (think how elphelt forces Faust to attack, it's the same here but jacko can force elphelt to take risks getting in).

The decision on whether or not to give up okizeme to kill houses or do weaker oki/spend yrc/rc to get extra hits is a stylistic choice. Unfortunately there is no clear cut answer other than try stuff out and see what works for you. 

I suggest bursting jacko if you see the opportunity to hit multiple houses rather than bursting her damage but again this is not objectively correct and you will need to try stuff out to see what works for your playstyle.

Don't forget to snipe Jacko doing j.d with your own j.d if they get too comfy with it.
This is one of the chars I recommend flickering FD for their initial meaty because her 2k and c.s are ridiculously good and leave her really close to you to do it again, if you need that breathing room then present FD.
