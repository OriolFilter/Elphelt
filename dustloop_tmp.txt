==Damage Optimization==

=== Number of Charged SG.H when routing into SG.S > Pull > [Charged SG.H]x3 > 6H/5H > Toss > 6H ===

* This assumes we are close to the corner.

* Standard ender used is {{clr|H|6H}} > {{clr|P|236P}}, unless specified the contrary.

* To reduce opponent height, after pulling berry ({{clr|S|SG.S}} > {{clr|P|236P}}}) we can delay the next {{clr|H|SG.H}}, this is specially relevant against lightweights, where they might be too high to combo normally, or we might have raised them through hits.

* As per the moment combos mainly only been tested on {{CLabel|GGXRD-R2|Sol|label=SO}}, unless specified the contrary.

* Dash micro optimization (66 {{clr|H|6H}}/{{clr|H|5H}} > {{clr|P|2Toss}}) is very important for consistency. We as well can perform a dash optimization with the ender {{clr|H|6H}} (66 {{clr|H|6H}}).

'''When to use {{clr|H|6H}} or {{clr|H|5H}} before {{clr|P|2Toss}} ?'''

* {{clr|H|6H}} generally speaking deals more damage than {{clr|H|5H}, usually with a damage variation of 10 +/-. On lightweights {{clr|H|5H}} can result on a damage increase of 1-3.

* {{clr|H|6H}} results in substantially more pushback than {{clr|H|5H}, which results on berry hitting on later frames, this is as well accentuated when the opponent is located at lower heights, as if they were located in a higher position, berry might have time to hit the opponent before they touch the ground. This pushback can be compensated with the micro-dash optimization (66 {{clr|H|6H}} {{clr|P|2Toss}}), yet can still be inconsistent depending on the opponent height/hurtbox.

* {{clr|H|6H}} pushes the opponent down, which on situations where the opponent is too close to the ground might make the combo drop, but on situations where the opponent is too high it might be helpful.

* {{clr|H|5H}} results in less pushback than {{clr|H|6H}} is more consistent, while still allowing for dash micro optimization for extra consistency (66 {{clr|H|5H}} > {{clr|P|2Toss}}).

* With {{clr|H|6H}} pushback, on lightweights and {{CLabel|GGXRD-R2|Venom|label=VE}} due to smaller hurtbox berry can harder to hit, therefore it's recommended to use {{clr|H|5H}}.

* When using {{clr|H|6H}} on heavyweights, even if their hurtbox is bigger, it can still be hard to hit the berry before they touch the ground, as generally speaking will have a height closer to the ground compared to other wieghtclasses, therefore it's recommended to use {{clr|H|5H}} for consistency.

* Both {{clr|H|5H}} and {{clr|H|6H}} allows for dash micro optimization (66 {{clr|H|6H}}/{{clr|H|5H}} > {{clr|P|2Toss}}).

TLDR:

* {{clr|H|5H}} is more consistent than {{clr|H|6H}.
* Use {{clr|H|5H}} on everyone including {{CLabel|GGXRD-R2|Venom|label=VE}}, and excluding the rest of midweights.
* Use {{clr|H|6H}} on midweights excluding {{CLabel|GGXRD-R2|Venom|label=VE}}, yet if the situation looks too tight, you can use {{clr|H|5H}}.
* Dash optimization is relevant on both normals (66 {{clr|H|6H}}/{{clr|H|5H}} > {{clr|P|2Toss}}).

| CH {{clr|H|6H}} > {{clr|S|SG.S}} || 232 (*242) || 2 (*3) || This route deals less damage than when using the route CH {{clr|H|6H}} > {{clr|S|SG.S}} > {{clr|2|214K}}, therefore it's recommended to use that one instead of this one. When the wall spacing is a bit sus. After the {{clr|H|6H}} we can do a small walkforward to gain a little bit more of wall proximity, it can also act as a framekill since we are waiting for the opponent to fall a bit lower, otherwise {{clr|S|SG.S}} might go under the opponent. Technically 3 {{clr|H|Charged SG.H}} can be done but requires us to be close to the wall since stun scaling goes tied to time in the combo. On the scenarios where we want to do this route we can do 2 {{clr|H|Charged SG.H}}, on the scenarios where we can do 3 {{clr|H|Charged SG.H}} we would be using the route without the {{clr|S|SG.S}} || [https://youtu.be/e3zmxdHkXaw Video]

Does 1 point more of damage than the base CH {{clr|H|6H}} route, for consistency/standardization/simplification this route can be used as a default, tho it generates a lil' bit more of Burst gauge, meanwhile it's negligible can be taken into account, specially when it only differs by 1 of damage. || [https://youtu.be/kQcNYmBl2Gs Video]
