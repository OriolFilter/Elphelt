## Shotgun Stance

## Entering SG Stance

- While not in SG stance (this includes being on sniper stance) do a 236H Motion

### Leaving SG stance

- On SG Stance do a 236H motion to remove yourself from the SG stance.

- On SG Stance do a 236S motion to enter the sniper stance state

- After shooting, Elphelt will leave the SG stance unless she [reloads](#reloading).

## Reloading

- To reload, after shooting, we do a `4 > 6 > H` input, it can as well be inputted as `4>6H`.

- This allows to "reload" the shotgun, and we get to keep the shotgun stance.

- The sooner you input the reload, the earlier you will reload, the earlier you will finish reloading.

- Unlike sniper there isn't a "perfect reload" timing. On Shotgun Stance is, the earlier, the better.

Example of reloading late vs early.

## Charging shotgun

- Charged Shotgun shots deal more damage and if close enough to the opponent (and wall) will wallsplat.

- The hitbox of the move is bigger and active at frame 1, meanwhile uncharged SG.H is active at frame 3.

- Elphelt requires to stand still 14 frames in order to charge shotgun.

- When shotgun is charged, you will momentarily see a pink glow around Elphelt, and as well a specific audio clue.

- If Elphelt moves, crouches or blocks, she will lose the charge and will need to hold for another 14 frames.

- SG.P, SG.K, SG.S, SG.D, Berry Toss and Bridal Express allow Elphelt to keep her charge, meanwhile SG.K resets the timer.
